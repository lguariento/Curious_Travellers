    <p> In 1817, Archibald-Montgomerie Williamson of Lixmount, Edinburgh (d.1844), probably then of
        a young age, accompanied her father on a tour of the west and south of Scotland. Little is
        known of Archibald-Montgomerie’s life, though her father Thomas (1756-1838) appears to have
        been of sufficient status to form the subject of a portrait by Henry Raeburn. Thirteen years
        after her tour, Archibald-Montgomerie would marry Henry Fairfax, son of the naval officer
        Sir William George and brother of the writer Mary Somerville. Leaving Edinburgh in early
        July, the Williamson travelled for roughly three weeks through the west and south of
        Scotland, their route representing a departure from the typical tourist itinerary of the
        period, and perhaps reflecting the business interests of Thomas. Of particular interest is
        Williamson’s account of her time in Glasgow, where she visits the recently opened Hunterian
        Museum, and attends a performance by the fire-eating Signora Girardelli and a sermon by the
        famous preacher Thomas Chalmers. The party then make an excursion to Loch Lomond and its
        islands, before travelling south down the Ayrshire coast, overland to Dumfries, and
        returning to Edinburgh via Moffat. Throughout, Williamson comments on gentlemen’s houses and
        estates, probably reflecting the use of a guidebook or roadbook either during the tour or
        during the composition of the journal. Like earlier tourists she also remarks on the state
        of agriculture and schemes of improvement in the towns and regions she passes through. In
        Dumfries, Williamson remarks on the recently built mausoleum of the poet Robert Burns
        (1759-1796), from whose work the topography of south-west Scotland was becoming increasingly
        inseparable. </p>
