                        To every particular friend and correspondent I send my most cordial thanks,
                        for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enquiries: and for
                        their bearing so long with my yearning after information; and with my
                        uncommon curiosity, without which no writer can proceed without the
                        confidence of accuracy, or ought to lay anything before the public
                        unsanctioned by local information. <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"/>

                    <p style="text-align:right;">Thomas Pennant, <i>Of London</i> (1790), v-vi</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Thomas Pennant's extant correspondence comprises some two thousand letters,
                        dating from 1750 to his death in 1798. Written for the most part in English,
                        but with occasional forays into Latin, French and Italian, the letters cover
                        a wide range of subjects, reflecting Pennant's ever-broadening interests and
                        his continual ‘yearning after information’. His determination to find
                        correspondents ready to exchange news, publications and specimens relating
                        to natural history is much in evidence in the early letters, which feature
                        the names of both influential and lesser-known figures such as the fossilist
                        Emanuel Mendes da Costa, the mineralogist and palaeontologist Giuseppe
                        Gravina, the ichthyologist Laurentius Gronovius, and the botanist and
                        zoologist Carl Linnaeus. Other scientifically-minded travellers such as
                        Joseph Banks and Peter Simon Pallas, and collectors such as Anna Blackburne
                        and the Countess of Portland also exchanged information and specimens. Some
                        of these were acquaintances made during Pennant’s continental tour in 1765,
                        and would become life-long correspondents. </p>
                    <p>Pennant’s background in natural history powerfully shaped his use of
                        correspondence networks as a travel writer, combining empirical observations
                        made ‘on the spot’ with materials systematically gathered from local
                        informants and existing sources. During his first Scottish tour of 1769
                        Pennant’s interests expanded to include topographical and antiquarian
                        subjects, and his circle of correspondents broadened considerably. This can
                        be seen especially in the letters relating to the second Scottish tour of
                        1772. A key figure here is George Paton, an Edinburgh customs officer with
                        antiquarian interests, who proved an invaluable contact for Pennant, both
                        before and after the journey. Correspondence with other Scottish informants,
                        such as Donald MacQueen of Kilmuir on Skye and Dr John Stuart of Killin and
                        Luss shows Pennant assiduously seeking the type of ‘local information’
                        (including questions about the Gaelic language and native customs) which
                        would validate his account, and reveal ‘true knowledge of your country,
                        hitherto misrepresented’. </p>
                    <p>The Welsh tours of the 1770s and early 1780s also absorb and reframe local
                        information gleaned from correspondents, such as the Worcestershire
                        clergyman Treadway Russell Nash, who provided evidence about Owain Glyndŵr,
                        or Pennant's friend, Paul Panton, senior, whose copies of antiquarian
                        documents were included verbatim in the published <i>Tours in Wales.</i>
                        Later in life, while still occupied in producing further editions of his
                        many works, he began compiling what he called his ‘magnum opus’, the
                        ‘imaginary tours’ known as the Outlines of the Globe. Adorned with prints
                        and original watercolours, the twenty-two volumes of this work involved him
                        in quests for information from all corners of the world, as well as for
                        visual records to corroborate it: artists, engravers and printers form
                        another important network in his rich correspondence. In addition to their
                        written content the letters contribute to our understanding of Enlightenment
                        knowledge production as a practice of physical as well as intellectual
                        circulation and exchange, that incorporated verbal descriptions alongside
                        visual representations and natural history specimens.</p>
                    <p>We gain more personal insights into Pennant as a man through correspondence
                        with family members, including his aunt, Elizabeth Pennant, to whom he
                        writes home from his Irish trip of 1754, and, most notably, his elder son,
                        David, the recipient of a series of paternal letters intended to instruct
                        and advise. These cover David Pennant's school years, his days as a student
                        at Christ Church College, Oxford, and his later continental tours of 1785–92
                        in Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France. As Justice of the Peace, Pennant
                        also took a close interest in matters of public order in his local area: his
                        correspondence reflects his efforts to set up a Loyalist Association on the
                        model of John Reeves in 1792, his pursuit of suspected felons and his rage
                        at improper behaviour relating to parliamentary representation.</p>
                    <h3>Aims of the Pennant Correspondence Project</h3>
                    <p>Our primary aim has been to produce digital, searchable editions of a
                        selection of Pennant’s letters, focusing on those which shed light on the
                        creation of his published tours. This work is ongoing, and completed edited
                        letters will continue to be added to the Curious Travellers site in the
                        future. A concomitant aim has been to compile a list of the entirety of
                        Pennant’s correspondence, and this work is being done in conjunction with
                        the Oxford Cultures of Knowledge project, <a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Early Modern
                            Letters Online</a> (EMLO). The EMLO database contains thousands of
                        letters from the seventeenth to the early-nineteenth centuries, allowing
                        users to search correspondence networks in a variety of ways. As we continue
                        to add information to EMLO, we are gaining a clearer picture of Pennant’s
                        interests at different points in his life (see <a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=thomas-pennant" target="_blank">The Correspondence of Thomas Pennant</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Archives</h3>
                    <p>The letters are preserved in disparate collections. The most substantial is
                        that held at Warwickshire County Record Office, deposited there with the
                        greater part of the Pennant family papers in 1980. Further significant
                        collections are found at the National Library of Wales and the National
                        Library of Scotland, with smaller deposits dispersed in various county
                        archives, including those of Cornwall, Cheshire, Cumbria, the East Riding of
                        Yorkshire, Flintshire, Staffordshire and Stoke and Suffolk, and in
                        libraries, museums and societies, from the British Library and the British
                        Museum, to Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Bodleian Library, Oxford,
                        Lambeth Palace Library, the Linnean Society, the Royal Society, Society of
                        Antiquaries, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Morrab Library,
                        Penzance. Reflecting Pennant's wide geographical interests, some letters are
                        preserved as far afield as the United States (at the American Philosophical
                        Society Library; Houghton Library, Harvard University; James Ford Bell
                        Collection at the University of Minnesota; New York Public Library; Paul
                        Mellon Collection, Virginia; Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass.; Pierpont Morgan
                        Library, New York; Pennsylvania State University Libraries); Australia
                        (Mitchell Library, Sydney; National Library of Australia) and New Zealand
                        (Alexander Turnbull Library). Most of Pennant's overseas correspondents were
                        based on mainland Europe but, while letters have surfaced at Uppsala
                        University Library, the possibility of locating material in libraries and
                        archives in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Russia is yet to be
                        fully investigated.</p>
