    <p> Elizabeth Susannah Graham (née Davenport, 1762 or 3-1844) of Edmond Castle, Cumbria, made an
        extensive tour of Scotland in September 1818 with her daughter Maria. Born in Clapham,
        Graham herself was a minor author, who under the pseudonyms of “Theresa Tidy” and “Lemuel
        Gulliver” respectively, had published two didactic volumes for children: <i>Eighteen Maxims of
        Neatness and Order</i> (1817) and <i>Voyage to Locutat; A Fragment</i> (1818). After proceeding from
        the Borders to Glasgow, Elizabeth and Graham take in many of the central and western
        Highland locations that formed the established ‘Petit-Tour’ of Scotland, as well as many of
        the isles, including Mull and Staffa; they returned home by Edinburgh. At points, the
        mother-daughter relationship of the two travellers sheds light on the gender and class
        dynamics of tourism in the period, with the younger Maria tackling paths ‘too bad for a lady
        to attempt’. Graham’s narrative reveals that she was a repeat visitor to Scotland, a status
        reflected in her accurate knowledge of Scottish mountains and their names, and her astute
        comments on the changing face of the landscape due to industrialisation around the towns of
        the central belt, and deforestation in the Trossachs. Graham’s descriptions of Highland
        hunting estates and a steam voyage on Loch Lomond, reflect the rapid development of a
        tourist and sporting economy in the Highlands in the early nineteenth century. Her narrative
        also illustrates Scotland and the Highlands’ consolidation as a literary landscape, which
        tourists increasingly mapped through the poems and Waverly novels of Walter Scott. While
        Graham’s account of the Trossachs and Loch Katrine in particular reflects that area’s
        increased fame as the setting for Scott’s <i>Lady of the Lake</i> (1810) and <i>Rob Roy</i> (1817), the
        urban topography of Edinburgh also appears through the lens of <i>Heart of Midlothian</i> (1818). </p>
