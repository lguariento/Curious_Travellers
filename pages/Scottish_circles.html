    <h2>Thomas Pennant's Scottish Circles</h2>
    <i>by Alex Deans</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">Spanning a period from the 1760s to the 1790s, the selection of Thomas Pennant's
            Scottish correspondence presented as part of this edition sheds new light on the
            composition and revision of Pennant's 1769 and 1772 <i>Tours of Scotland</i>,
            first published in 1771 and 1774 respectively. Letters to and from Pennant's
            Scottish contacts confirm the polyvocal character of the <i>Tours</i>, as the
            product not of a single author's observations, but rather a myriad of
            perspectives and sources. Taken as a whole, these letters tell us much about the
            practices of intellectual exchange common to travel writing, antiquarianism and
            natural history. The contents of Pennant's letters to the naturalist David
            Skene, and later his three-decade correspondence with the Edinburgh customs
            clerk George Paton, reflect the early impetus of Pennant's domestic travels in
            the study of natural history, and the way in which its imperatives of
            description, comparison and collation overlapped with the social, historical,
            and geographical concerns of the tourist. Pennant's letters, as both a record of
            activity and in terms of their content, exemplify James Secord's conception of
            'knowledge-making itself as a form of communicative action,'<sup>1</sup> in which the mobile
            and exchangeable quality of information, and the practicalities that surround
            its inscription, transmission and iteration, merit the same attention as the
            published text. But as much as Pennant's interest in the natural world, these
            letters testify to the richness of the archival, visual, and printed materials
            brought together by his research, and point to what Gwyn Walters, in reference
            to Pennant's cartographical activities (documented in the correspondence with
            Paton) has called the 'coordination of sources'<sup>2</sup> as the compositional mode of
            Pennant's <i>Tours</i>.</p>
        <p>The expanded quantity of material relating to Pennant's
            <i>A tour in Scotland 1772</i>, in comparison to <i>1769</i>, reflects the
            more organised ethos of that project and the growing range of contacts and
            interests brought to bear in its preparation for the press. Particularly crucial
            in the period following Pennant's return from Scotland in 1772 were his
            correspondences with the Highland ministers, Donald MacQueen of Kilmuir on Skye,
            and Dr John Stuart of Killin and later Luss, the latter of whom had accompanied
            Pennant on that year's expedition as a botanist and Gaelicist.</p>
        <p>These letters
            reveal the ways in which Gaelic speakers were proactive in shaping the broader
            British representation of their culture and language, with much of MacQueen and
            Stuart's writing incorporated wholesale into the text of <i>A tour in Scotland
                1772.</i> These letters also provide insight into a broader intellectual
            community of antiquarians, natural historians, collectors and topographers, on
            whose expertise and resources Pennant was able to draw as a figure of renown,
            highlighting the importance of what Noah Heringman calls 'knowledge work':<sup>3</sup> the
            labour of those outside the gentlemanly elite of enlightenment intellectual
            society. On the other hand, the correspondence frequently illuminates
            sociability as an element of network building, with many letters touching on the
            familial and the domestic, or voicing responses to contemporary political events
            such as the American War of Independence.</p>
        <p>The private takes a different form in
            those letters that relate to Pennant's business dealings with artists,
            engravers, booksellers and printers in Edinburgh, London and north-west England.
            While Pennant maintained the persona of a disinterested gentleman of letters in
            introductions to his printed works, his correspondence reveals his commercial
            savvy in navigating the cut and thrust of the book trade, the costs of printing
            and publishing, and the rewards and risks of authorship. This aspect of the
            letters underlines Pennant's significance as a figure whose work combined a
            polite culture of intellectual amateurism, with a keen sense of travel writing's
            burgeoning authority and popularity as a genre of eighteenth-century literature. </p>
