        <h3>The Letters of Thomas Pennant</h3>
        
        
        <blockquote>To every particular friend and correspondent I send my most cordial thanks, for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enquiries: and for their bearing so long with my yearning after information; and with my uncommon curiosity, without which no writer can proceed without the confidence of accuracy, or ought to lay anything before the public unsanctioned by local information. 
        <br/>Thomas Pennant, <i>Of London</i> (1790), v-vi</blockquote>
        
        
<p>        Thomas Pennant's extant correspondence comprises some two thousand letters, dating from 1750 to his death in 1798. Written for the most part in English, but with occasional forays into Latin, French and Italian, the letters cover a wide range of subjects, reflecting Pennant's ever-broadening interests and his continual ‘yearning after information’. His determination to find correspondents ready to exchange news, publications and specimens relating to natural history is much in evidence in the early letters, which feature the names of both influential and lesser-known figures such as the fossilist Emanuel Mendes da Costa, the mineralogist and palaeontologist Giuseppe Gravina, the ichthyologist Laurentius Gronovius, and the botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus. Other scientifically-minded travellers such as Joseph Banks and Peter Simon Pallas, and collectors such as Anna Blackburne and the Countess of Portland also exchanged information and specimens. Some of these were acquaintances made during Pennant’s continental tour in 1765, and would become life-long correspondents. </p>
        
<p>        Pennant’s background in natural history powerfully shaped his use of correspondence networks as a travel writer, combining empirical observations made ‘on the spot’ with materials systematically gathered from local informants and existing sources. During his first Scottish tour of 1769 Pennant’s interests expanded to include topographical and antiquarian subjects, and his circle of correspondents broadened considerably. This can be seen especially in the letters relating to the second Scottish tour of 1772. A key figure here is George Paton, an Edinburgh customs officer with antiquarian interests, who proved an invaluable contact for Pennant, both before and after the journey. Correspondence with other Scottish informants, such as Donald MacQueen of Kilmuir on Skye and Dr John Stuart of Killin and Luss shows Pennant assiduously seeking the type of ‘local information’ (including questions about the Gaelic language and native customs) which would validate his account, and reveal ‘true knowledge of your country, hitherto misrepresented’. </p>
        
<p>        The Welsh tours of the 1770s and early 1780s also absorb and reframe local information gleaned from correspondents, such as the Worcestershire clergyman Treadway Russell Nash, who provided evidence about Owain Glyndŵr, or Pennant's friend, Paul Panton, senior, whose copies of antiquarian documents were included verbatim in the published <i>Tours in Wales.</i> Later in life, while still occupied in producing further editions of his many works,  he began compiling what he called his ‘magnum opus’, the ‘imaginary tours’ known as the Outlines of the Globe. Adorned with prints and original watercolours, the twenty-two volumes of this work involved him in quests for information from all corners of the world, as well as for visual records to corroborate it: artists, engravers and printers form another important network in his rich correspondence. In addition to their written content the letters contribute to our understanding of Enlightenment knowledge production as a practice of physical as well as intellectual circulation and exchange, that incorporated verbal descriptions alongside visual representations and natural history specimens.</p>
        
<p>        We gain more personal insights into Pennant as a man through correspondence with family members, including his aunt, Elizabeth Pennant, to whom he writes home from his Irish trip of 1754, and, most notably, his elder son, David, the recipient of a series of paternal letters intended to instruct and advise. These cover David Pennant's school years, his days as a student at Christ Church College, Oxford, and his later continental tours of 1785–92 in Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France. As Justice of the Peace, Pennant also took a close interest in matters of public order in his local area: his correspondence reflects his efforts to set up a Loyalist Association on the model of John Reeves in 1792, his pursuit of suspected felons and his rage at improper behaviour relating to parliamentary representation.</p>
        
        <h5>Aims of the Pennant Correspondence Project</h5> 
<p>        Our primary aim has been to produce digital, searchable editions of a selection of Pennant’s letters, focusing on those which shed light on the creation of his published tours. This work is ongoing, and completed edited letters will continue to be added to the Curious Travellers site in the future. A concomitant aim has been to compile a list of the entirety of Pennant’s correspondence, and this work is being done in conjunction with the Oxford Cultures of Knowledge project, Early Modern Letters Online (EMLO). The EMLO database contains thousands of letters from the seventeenth to the early-nineteenth centuries, allowing users to search correspondence networks in a variety of ways. As we continue to add information to EMLO, we are gaining a clearer picture of Pennant’s interests at different points in his life.  [LINK HERE]      </p>
        
        <h5>Archives</h5>
<p>        The letters are preserved in disparate collections. The most substantial is that held at Warwickshire County Record Office, deposited there with the greater part of the Pennant family papers in 1980. Further significant collections are found at the National Library of Wales and the National Library of Scotland, with smaller deposits dispersed in various county archives, including those of Cornwall, Cheshire, Cumbria, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Flintshire, Staffordshire and Stoke and Suffolk, and in libraries, museums and societies, from the British Library and the British Museum, to Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Lambeth Palace Library, the Linnean Society, the Royal Society, Society of Antiquaries, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Morrab Library, Penzance. Reflecting Pennant's wide geographical interests, some letters are preserved as far afield as the United States (at the American Philosophical Society Library; Houghton Library, Harvard University; James Ford Bell Collection at the University of Minnesota; New York Public Library; Paul Mellon Collection, Virginia; Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass.; Pierpont Morgan Library, New York; Pennsylvania State University Libraries); Australia (Mitchell Library, Sydney; National Library of Australia) and New Zealand (Alexander Turnbull Library). Most of Pennant's overseas correspondents were based on mainland Europe but, while letters have surfaced at Uppsala University Library, the possibility of locating material in libraries and archives in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Russia is yet to be fully investigated.</p>

                    <h2>The Correspondence of Thomas Pennant and Richard Bull, 1773–1798</h2>
                    <p>Numbering 219 letters, the correspondence between Thomas Pennant and Richard
                        Bull spans a quarter of a century and gives us an unique insight into a
                        central feature of Pennant's work as an author: his extra-illustration of
                        his own published and manuscript texts. Bull, an M.P. and passionate
                        collector of printed portraits, had been extra-illustrating James Granger's
                            <i>A Biographical History of England </i>between 1769 and 1774: he now
                        turned his sights towards the possibilities and potential of Pennant's
                        topographical works for extra-illustrators or grangerizers, striking up an
                        acquaintance with the latter from 1773. Bull and his mentor Granger were
                        initially interested in the painted copies of portrait heads which Pennant
                        had encountered during his second Scottish tour of 1772, and in his
                        provision of published engravings from them. The artist who copied the
                        portraits of the Admirable Crichton and the Countess of Desmond was
                        Pennant's 'Servant-painter', the Llŷn-born Moses Griffith. As the 1770s
                        progressed, Pennant began to adorn the margins of his published tours,
                        printed on large paper, with drawings of localities, portraits and coats of
                        arms created by Griffith, and this work circulated among a close coterie of
                        gentlemen to great effect. Bull gradually earned Pennant's permission to
                        allow Griffith to work for him as well as for his master, thus establishing
                        a mutually beneficial relationship which resulted in the extra-illustration
                        of a number of Pennant's works, not only topographical, but also of natural
                        history and autobiography. Bull's contribution to this arrangement ranged
                        from guidance on how to paste prints into the margins of his books (a
                        service provided by his daughters, the Miss Bulls) to assistance in
                        'puff[ing] off' the work of Moses Griffith and helping him break into the
                        London market in printed engravings. Bull was also tireless in finding
                        prints suited to the extra-illustration in particular of Pennant's 'opus
                        magnum', his multi-volume 'Outlines of the Globe', a largely 'imaginary'
                        tour covering distant lands never visited by the author. The Pennant-Bull
                        correspondence shows how several volumes of the 'Outlines' were created with
                        images in mind, with Pennant, perhaps informed by his background in natural
                        history, always mindful of the illustrative aspect of his literary work.</p>
                    <p>This rich correspondence is enhanced by the development of the personal
                        relationship between the writers: starting with a brief, business-like note
                        from Pennant in 1773, it evolves into a record of the twin tragedies of the
                        loss of a daughter by both families, and of the trials of approaching old
                        age. It is a memorable body of letters, offering insights into Pennant's
                        character which cannot be found elsewhere.</p>

                                <p>Spanning a period from the 1760s to the 1790s, the selection of Thomas Pennant's
                                    Scottish correspondence presented as part of this edition sheds new light on the
                                    composition and revision of Pennant's 1769 and 1772 <i>Tours of Scotland</i>,
                                    first published in 1771 and 1774 respectively. Letters to and from Pennant's
                                    Scottish contacts confirm the polyvocal character of the <i>Tours</i>, as the
                                    product not of a single author's observations, but rather a myriad of
                                    perspectives and sources. Taken as a whole, these letters tell us much about the
                                    practices of intellectual exchange common to travel writing, antiquarianism and
                                    natural history. The contents of Pennant's letters to the naturalist David
                                    Skene, and later his three-decade correspondence with the Edinburgh customs
                                    clerk George Paton, reflect the early impetus of Pennant's domestic travels in
                                    the study of natural history, and the way in which its imperatives of
                                    description, comparison and collation overlapped with the social, historical,
                                    and geographical concerns of the tourist. Pennant's letters, as both a record of
                                    activity and in terms of their content, exemplify James Secord's conception of
                                    'knowledge-making itself as a form of communicative action,'<sup>1</sup> in which the mobile
                                    and exchangeable quality of information, and the practicalities that surround
                                    its inscription, transmission and iteration, merit the same attention as the
                                    published text. But as much as Pennant's interest in the natural world, these
                                    letters testify to the richness of the archival, visual, and printed materials
                                    brought together by his research, and point to what Gwyn Walters, in reference
                                    to Pennant's cartographical activities (documented in the correspondence with
                                    Paton) has called the 'coordination of sources'<sup>2</sup> as the compositional mode of
                                    Pennant's <i>Tours</i>.</p>
                                <p>The expanded quantity of material relating to Pennant's
                                    <i>A tour in Scotland 1772</i>, in comparison to <i>1769</i>, reflects the
                                    more organised ethos of that project and the growing range of contacts and
                                    interests brought to bear in its preparation for the press. Particularly crucial
                                    in the period following Pennant's return from Scotland in 1772 were his
                                    correspondences with the Highland ministers, Donald MacQueen of Kilmuir on Skye,
                                    and Dr John Stuart of Killin and later Luss, the latter of whom had accompanied
                                    Pennant on that year's expedition as a botanist and Gaelicist.</p>
                                <p>These letters
                                    reveal the ways in which Gaelic speakers were proactive in shaping the broader
                                    British representation of their culture and language, with much of MacQueen and
                                    Stuart's writing incorporated wholesale into the text of <i>A tour in Scotland
                                        1772.</i> These letters also provide insight into a broader intellectual
                                    community of antiquarians, natural historians, collectors and topographers, on
                                    whose expertise and resources Pennant was able to draw as a figure of renown,
                                    highlighting the importance of what Noah Heringman calls 'knowledge work':<sup>3</sup> the
                                    labour of those outside the gentlemanly elite of enlightenment intellectual
                                    society. On the other hand, the correspondence frequently illuminates
                                    sociability as an element of network building, with many letters touching on the
                                    familial and the domestic, or voicing responses to contemporary political events
                                    such as the American War of Independence.</p>
                                <p>The private takes a different form in
                                    those letters that relate to Pennant's business dealings with artists,
                                    engravers, booksellers and printers in Edinburgh, London and north-west England.
                                    While Pennant maintained the persona of a disinterested gentleman of letters in
                                    introductions to his printed works, his correspondence reveals his commercial
                                    savvy in navigating the cut and thrust of the book trade, the costs of printing
                                    and publishing, and the rewards and risks of authorship. This aspect of the
                                    letters underlines Pennant's significance as a figure whose work combined a
                                    polite culture of intellectual amateurism, with a keen sense of travel writing's
                                    burgeoning authority and popularity as a genre of eighteenth-century literature. </p>
