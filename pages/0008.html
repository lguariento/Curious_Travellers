    <p>The extensive unpublished archive of Katherine Plymley (bap. 1758, d. 1829), which runs to
        over 200 volumes of diaries, memoirs and study notebooks, includes some 30 volumes of travel
        writing. The tour of north Wales reproduced here, in which Plymley travelled from Shropshire
        to Anglesey and back in 1792 in the company of her brother and sister, belongs to the
        earlier part of her archive. The Plymleys, who lived in Longnor, south of Shrewsbury, were
        part of the Shropshire Enlightenment; family friends and associates included the Darwins and
        Wedgwoods. Neither Katherine nor her sister, Ann, ever married, and they spent much of their
        time helping to raise their nieces and nephews (children of their brother, Joseph), three of
        whom accompanied the elder Plymleys on the 1792 Welsh tour. </p>

    <p>Plymley explains in one of her volumes of memoirs that her responsibility for educating the
        children after the death of their mother, Jane Plymley (née Panton; d. 1787), motivated her
        to continue her own studies, in order ‘that we [Plymley and her sister Ann] may be more
        capable of informing them’.<sup>1</sup> Family matters also shaped their home tourism: the
        1792 tour was partly undertaken in order to visit the family of Joseph Plymley’s late first
        wife at Plasgwyn on Anglesey, while the 1802 tour through south Wales to Cornwall and the
        Scilly Isles was made in an attempt to improve the health of her niece Jane (1787-1807).</p>

    <p>The Welsh tour of 1792 also hints at intellectual and conversable worlds beyond the more
        immediate setting of the family. As Jo Dahn has pointed out, Plymley’s diaries deal with a
        huge variety of material, from the minutiae of daily life to ‘fashion and manners, farming,
        landscape, estate management, economics, politics, pageantry, art, architecture, design,
        science, industry, and religion’.<sup>2</sup> In Shropshire, the Plymleys were part of and
        passionately interested in the movement for the abolition of slavery: the abolitionist
        Thomas Clarkson was a close family friend, and it is through her relationship with him in
        particular that we can trace Plymley’s views as a radical Whig.<sup>3</sup> Another key
        abolitionist, William Wilberforce, appears briefly in the 1792 tour, when for Plymley the
        landscape around Conwy brings to mind a quotation from Oliver Goldsmith’s <i>The Deserted
            Village </i>(1770), quoted by Wilberforce in a celebrated parliamentary speech in favour
        of abolition in April 1792 (see vol. 1, ff. 22v-23r).</p>

    <p>Plymley’s tour details a number of key sites on the tour of north Wales, including a visit to
        Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby at Llangollen (vol. 1, ff. 5v-9r), and the picturesque
        landscape surrounding the town. More unusually, she also comments on the social fabric of
        Llangollen, lamenting the condition of the poor, who could, she feels, be more usefully
        employed (vol. 1, f. 9v). Further west on Anglesey, she describes the sociable world of the
        Bulkeley, Paget and Panton families (vol. 2, ff. 5r-17r), who dominated the island’s
        political and social life in this period. However this tour is particularly notable for
        Plymley’s account of a visit to Thomas Pennant at Downing Hall as part of the return trip.
        Connections between the two families were longstanding: Plymley’s father, Joseph
        (1716-1802), had contributed illustrations to Pennant’s <i>British Zoology</i> in the 1760s,
        and the Plymleys appear to have been greeted as old friends. Pennant’s longtime artist,
        Moses Griffith, made portraits of the Plymley children (vol. 3, f. 11v), though these are
        not known to have survived. Plymley, who also painted (fig. 1), was an amateur entomologist
        (her scientific interests are more evident on her 1802 travels through south Wales), and the
        evidence of this tour suggests that she and Pennant had much to discuss: ‘our time did not
        permit us to see nearly all the numberless drawings, &amp; curiosities that M<sup>r</sup>:
        Pennant has collected, yet we were never idle, &amp; were highly entertained’ (vol. 3, fol.
            9v).<sup>4</sup>
