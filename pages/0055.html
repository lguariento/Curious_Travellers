    <p>Sir John MacGregor Murray’s journal of his 1800 tour of the Highlands and Western Isles is a rich and challenging text, that provides a unique insight into both the history of the region, and the cultural debates that arose in the wake of James Macpherson’s Ossian translations. MacGregor Murray assumed chieftainship of clan Gregor following the repeal of its prohibition, having previously served as a general in the East India Company service and auditor of Bengal. The journal records that MacGregor Murray, by then in his mid-sixties, was accompanied by his son Evan on a tour that began in Edinburgh and passed through Breadalbane to Argyll, before embarking for Mull, Morvern, Staffa and eventually the Outer Isles. The tour seems to have been motivated by a variety of factors, among them MacGregor Murray’s role as a Commissioner of the estates of Macdonald of Sleat, then engaged in a dramatic plan of modernisation, particularly in North Uist. However MacGregor Murray’s own fraught ancestral history of conflict and forfeiture, as revealed through anecdotes and specific sites is also a major focus of the journal, with the fortunes of various MacGregors and their antagonists providing a vivid window upon the often violent and intensely dynastic past of the Highlands. </p>
        <p>Crucially, MacGregor Murray was a Gaelic speaker, and his journal is thus alert to the contemporary concerns of Highlanders in a way that is relatively rare among tours from this period. Of particular interest are his dealings with the tenants of the British Fisheries Society, newly settled in the village of Tobermory on Mull, whose grievances provide a first-hand perspective on the cultural and material tensions of Highland improvement and clearance. Perhaps most intriguingly of all, the tour takes place at a crucial point in the ongoing controversy surrounding the authenticity of James Macpherson’s translations of Ossian. Frequent mention is made of Malcolm Laing’s 1800 essay refuting Macpherson’s claims that the poems originated in ancient Gaelic tradition. More directly, it appears from the journal that MacGregor Murray was present at the pseudo-legal hearings on the Outer Isles in 1800, where local figures testified both to the authenticity of Ossianic tradition, and to Macpherson’s access to the primary manuscript and oral sources of the poems in his own tour of 1760. The declarations witnessed and recorded by MacGregor Murray are also printed in Henry Mackenzie’s <i>Report of the Committee of the Highland Society of Scotland, Appointed to Inquire into the Nature and Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian</i> (1800), positioning the journal as an important and underexplored perspective on one of the central preoccupations of the Highland tour as a genre, and on the mediation of Gaelic culture in the period.</p>
        <p>We are grateful to Dr Martin MacGregor and the members of Comann-rannsachaidh air Eachdraidh nan Gàidheal ann an Alba, University of Glasgow, for reading the transcribed text of this tour and sharing their invaluable knowledge of its subject matter and contexts. In particular, Dr Aonghas MacCoinnich has supplied translations, corrections and notes relating to some of the Gaelic sections of the document. Readers should be aware however that this text was transcribed by a non-Gaelic speaker. Moreover, both MacGregor Murray’s handwriting and spelling in Gaelic are at times idiosyncratic, and there may be irregularities in the Gaelic passages of the text.</p>
