        A native of Gloucestershire, Daniel Lysons worked as a physician at the Gloucester Infirmary following his qualification as a doctor in 1756, moving in 1770 to Bath, where he later became employed at the town's General Hospital. His acquaintance with Pennant predates this move, with the earliest of the four extant letters [<a href="/doc/1300">1300</a>, May 1764] giving us a glimpse of Lysons's preoccupation with his medical work, both in his official role as employee of the Infirmary ('I find myself in full Employment. the Infirmary very full ...'), and in a personal capacity (he offers Pennant advice on the health of his first wife, Elizabeth (née Falconer), who was to die very shortly afterwards). Lysons is also clearly involved in Pennant's projects: he gives a detailed account of the prices for printing in 'Pica Letter' on a range of paper types of various qualities at a Gloucester printer's establishment, evidently in answer to a query from Pennant, and also offers his criticism of the figures of two birds included in the latter's <i>British zoology</i>, in a version published in parts between 1763 and 1766: 'The Wood Pigeon I thought a bird of Prey by its attitude ...'.</p>
        
        <p>The remainder of the letters turn more fully to matters of natural history, with a focus on ichthyology. Writing on 19 and 26 September 1767 (<a href="/doc/1301">1301</a>, <a href="/doc/1302">1302</a>), Lysons responds to a query from Pennant for 'a list of the fish we have in the Severn'. His first letter opens with a detailed account of the methods used by fishermen to capture salmon in the river Severn, the division of the labour on two boats between the four men operating each one, and the sharing out of the profits between the eight men and their master. Another method, used in shallower water, is also described. Lysons's second letter on this topic offers observations on several other fish, among them the shad and the twaite, whose names are confused by Londoners, he maintains, with the twaite ('a bad fish ...') mistakenly called a shad, so that 'the Londoners have ^a bad opinion of the true shad'. Throughout, Lysons shows his awareness of the life cycles of the fish, the times at which they breed, their locations in the Severn and its tributaries at various times of the year, how they are captured and marketed by fishermen, and how received in London. The sources of information which he uses include 'accounts ... from people of that country [beyond Shrewsbury]', and in a later letter of November 1767 (<a href="/doc/1303">1303</a>) he suggests that Pennant should join him the following summer, so that they can 'enquire more particularly into this Species of fish [the conger eel]'. This letter ends on a subject which touches on Lysons's medical training: addressing the statements made by Dr Rice Charleton, a Bath physician, about the 'Devonshire colic', he posits, with the Exeter surgeon, Francis Geach, that the illness is caused not by the ascent of 'acidum vagum fossile' into the veins of plants but by the use of unripe or improperly fermented fruit.</p>
