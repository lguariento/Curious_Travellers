    <h2>Thomas Pennant's Welsh Circles</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">The letters presented here under the title 'Welsh Circles' represent in the broadest sense the correspondences in which Thomas Pennant engaged relating to Wales. They encompass his early naturalist interests as well as his researches for the creation and subsequent re-edition of <i>A tour in Wales</i> (1st edn., 1778, 1781, 1783; 2nd edn., 1784), but are by no means confined to his Welsh interests alone. Other publications and tours outside Wales, including <i>A journey to London</i> (1782) and his lost (or never-to-be-produced) account of a journey to the Isle of Man (1774), feature in the discussions presented here. The correspondents are, for the most part, Pennant's fellow-Welshmen, many local to his native county of Flintshire or neighbouring Denbighshire, and include his right-hand man, John Lloyd of Caerwys, and his namesake, John Lloyd of Hafodunos and Wigfair, alongside the squire of Erddig Hall near Wrexham, and a fellow-enthusiast in the field of genealogy, Philip Yorke. Contacts from the other side of Offa's Dyke feature in the persons of Daniel Lysons, a Gloucestershire physician with whom Pennant had exchanges concerning the fish of the river Severn, and Treadway Russell Nash of Bevere near Worcester, who shared Pennant's fascination with the seminal fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century Welsh hero, Owain Glyndwr. Expatriate Welshmen are represented by the lexicographer William Owen (later William Owen Pughe), from whose communications about London Pennant benefitted greatly in producing his account of the capital, <i>Of London</i> (1790).</p>
