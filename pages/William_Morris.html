    <h2>William Morris (1705–63)</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
<br/>
    <br/>
    <p>William Morris and Thomas Pennant first met in June 1754, when Pennant called at Morris's
        Holyhead home, with a letter of introduction from a common acquaintance. The two then
        indulged in their joint interest in specimen collection along the nearby shores before
        Pennant's departure by sea on a trip to Ireland. The friendship which developed between the
        two men involved frequent exchange of letters and several face-to-face meetings. Shared
        trips involving natural history collection included an ascent of Snowdon in the summer of
        1755; a visit to Plas Gwyn, the Anglesey home of Paul Panton, in August 1758; a trip to
        Puffin Island, Gloddaith and Conwy in June 1761; and an excursion to Downing in July 1757.
        Yet, the extant correspondence between Pennant and Morris is limited to four letters from
        the latter to Pennant, dated between 14 January 1756 and 5 February 1760. A letter of 2
        November 1754 from Pennant to an unnamed recipient is also included in this edition on the
        basis of concurrences in its contents with information disclosed in correspondence between
        William Morris and his brother Richard at around the same time. Further reading of the
        voluminous correspondence of the Morris brothers (Richard and William, alongside their elder
        sibling Lewis) reveals much more about the relationship between Pennant and William Morris
        than can be gleaned from the extant autograph letters alone. Frequent references to 'y
        Bennant' ('the Bennant', gleefully mutated as a feminine noun) portray the Flintshire man's
        active and industrious personality; his central role in inciting others to partake of his
        interest in disseminating knowledge about the natural world; his generous gifting of books
        and boxes of specimens from his continental network of vituosos, a 'Sicilian Prince' among
        them, and his manner of pestering Morris for Anglesey samples in return; his grief at the
        loss of his first-born; his scanty knowledge of the Welsh language. As well as William
        Morris's (often colourful) view of Pennant, we find résumés of the contents of some of the
        correspondence with Morris and, in several cases, quotations from the letters
        themselves.</p>

    <p>A focus on the extant autograph letters edited here enables us to hone in on some of the
        characteristics so tantalizingly preserved in Morris's letters to his brothers. The earliest
        letter, if indeed William Morris may be allowed to be its recipient, shows Pennant, in
        typical foreman mode, sending 'a trifling acknowledgement' of favours conferred upon him by
        his recipient, and demanding a box-ful of specimens in return. William Morris's letter of 11
        November 1754 to his brother Richard in London suggests that the acknowledgement was in fact
        not at all negligible: astounded at Pennant's liberality, he reports the arrival of a box
        containing twenty six parcels of a wide variety of curiosities, adding that he is now to
        return the box filled with some of the 'wonders of Anglesey' in return. Pennant's letter
        explains that these are needed so that he can fulfill a promise of sending 'sea weeds to her
        grace of Chandos', a lady evidently interested in natural history. Alongside this brief
        missive, the extant letters from William Morris begin in the stormy January of 1756, where
        the traffic between the ports of Holyhead and Dublin has been halted by 'Westerly Winds
        &amp; Storms' for the past month, where opportunities to explore the beach below high water
        mark have been nonexistent for a long time, and where a collecting trip to Llanddwyn Point,
        in the south-west of the island, has failed to reveal any specimens of note. Yet, in spite
        of the tempestuous conditions at sea, Morris is able to attach a long list of flowers in
        blow or in bud at his garden, suggesting a colourful and comforting winter blossoming within
        the microclimate of Holy Island. An undercurrent in this letter is the mention of literary
        exchanges, from an almanac, possibly sourced at Dublin and sent as an enclosure to Pennant,
        to a copy of the 'French Conchyl[olog]y', a 'Superbe performance' lent to Morris by Pennant
        but now ready to be returned.</p>

    <p>The second extant letter from Morris records his return home after a visit to Downing in July
        1757, in the company of Revd Thomas Ellis, curate at Holyhead, whose acquaintance with
        Pennant predated Morris's. Now familiar with Pennant's family – his father and twin sisters
        – Morris and Ellis greet and thank them for their courteous welcome. The letter gives us
        insights into the journey home to Anglesey: we are on the road with Morris as he looks on
        with disapproval at a handful of workers employed in improving the road at Morfa Rhuddlan,
        dismissing them as 'a Burlesque upon Roadmaking', and comparing the efforts to amend the
        roads in Denbighshire and other north Wales counties disapprovingly with those afoot in
        Pennant's Flintshire. Involving both natural history and antiquarian pursuits as Morris and
        Ellis travelled through Diserth and the environs of Rhos-on-sea and Penmaen Rhos
        (regrettably there was no time to visit Llandudno), the homecoming appears to have been a
        continuation in some respects of conversations had at Downing during the visit. Maen
        Achwyfan, the monolithic cross situated in Pennant's home parish of Whitford, was in
        Morris's thoughts as he viewed two pillars at Diserth Churchyard, concluding that they
        offered support to Pennant's conjecture that the Flintshire cross was set up in celebration
        of a Christian or other religious occasion. Also noteworthy at Diserth was the flinty
        material within the limestone of a resident's house, which could be compared to material at
        Arkendale in Yorkshire as mentioned by John Woodward in his 1729 study of English fossils.
        Morris evidently consulted his library upon his arrival home for this information, and
        appears to have made use of books by John Ray and Edward Lhuyd in order to identify corals
        found (and sent to Pennant before they wasted away) between Penmaen Rhos and Rhos-on-sea.
        Likewise, he used the horticultural works of John Gerard and Joseph Miller to help him
        recognize a plant which he characterized as an 'important discovery' and which he had heard
        given an unfamiliar name in discussions with Pennant's gardener.</p>

    <p>The visit to Downing was still in William Morris's thoughts as he wrote to Pennant in the
        February of the following year. He did not remember seeing there the green amiantus, a
        variety of asbestos, but could report that he had now encountered it in his own
        neighbourhood. Further natural history news in this letter centres on marine specimens, in
        particular 'a Large Dolphin [which] was driven dead into this Harbour'. Morris's visual
        representation of this and 'Several bodies' thrown ashore at a great ebb during the last
        spring tide, are withheld until Pennant, who appears to have been quartered at Bath out of
        the reach of his correspondents during the winter months, should return to his Downing
        'Musæum'. Mentioned in the context of drawing is a plan of Pennant's for creating 'a new
        Catalogue', the benefits of which will be ensured by his capabilities as 'a draughtsman', an
        ability envied by Morris as his underlining of the words demonstrates. Image-enhanced
        cataloguing was to become a guiding feature of Pennant's first major study, <i>British
            Zoology</i>, and this may be a reference to the earliest evolutionary stages of that
        project. Another development suggested in this letter is contained in Morris's incredulous
        exclamation, 'What, drop all your foreign Fossil friends!' – presumably a response to a
        claim in a previous letter from Pennant that he was no longer to continue the correspondence
        and specimen exchange which he had fostered with natural historians and antiquaries in
        continental Europe since 1753, and an intimation that he was perhaps shifting his centre of
        interest away from rocks or mineral substances. This movement is not strongly corroborated
        by the evidence of Pennant's correspondence with a range of contacts in continental Europe,
        since he continued to exchange letters and specimens into the following decade; yet, read
        alongside William Morris's words in this letter, Ferdinando Bassi's congratulations to
        Pennant in March 1759 for taking up a 'new mistress, Botany' may suggest that Pennant was
        toying with the idea of a change of focus from the beginning of 1758.</p>

    <p>The final extant letter, dated 5 February 1760, provides an example of William Morris's skill
        at creating 'Icons', in the form of drawings from three angles of a new fish, 'like to turn
        out a Non descript', or not previously described specimen. An amusing anecdote attends this
        fish: Morris and his daughter apparently decided to eat it, to Pennant's great dismay. In
        all fairness, Morris had not consumed the fish before ensuring that he could provide
        detailed descriptions of its characteristics, using verbal explanation linked with lables to
        the diagrams, and exploring the works of Francis Willughby and Charles Smith as well as
        material in the Royal Society's <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> in an attempt to find
        descriptions of closely related specimens. The letter ends with warm wishes of happiness to
        Pennant's first wife, Elizabeth (née Falconer) who was at that time expecting the couple's
        first child – playfully described by Morris as 'a Sucking Virtuoso'.</p>
