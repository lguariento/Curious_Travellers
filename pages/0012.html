    <h1>Robert Ker Porter, <i>Journal of a Tour in North Wales</i> (1799)</h1>


    <p>On 11 July 1799, the 22-year-old Scottish painter (later traveller and diplomat) Robert Ker
        Porter (1777-1842) arrived in Shrewsbury, ahead of a walking and sketching tour of north
        Wales. Porter had for company his friend and fellow artist Thomas Underwood (1772-1835), on
        a month-long and roughly circular tour that took them across mid-Wales to the western
        coastline (including Dolgellau and Barmouth), then up to Snowdonia, and back through the
        Vale of Clwyd to Chester and the Peak District.</p>

    <p>Born in Durham, Porter grew up in Edinburgh, where he showed huge promise as a painter. He
        moved to London in 1791 in order to attend school at the Royal Academy, and the world of art
        went on to define the rest of this decade for him. It was almost certainly the motivation
        behind his visit to Wales in 1799. Porter frequently mentions drawing and sketching outdoors
        on this tour, and notes that he and Underwood met up with other artists, including Louis
        Francia and one of the Varley brothers (probably John Varley), during their travels (see ff.
        55, 89). These men had become part of a network of brilliant young artists in 1790s London
        that included JMW Turner and Thomas Girtin. Porter’s closer, more immediate group of artist
        friends was known as ‘the Brothers’; formed in May 1799, this group included Underwood and
        Francia and met (as Francia noted on the back of one of his sketches) in order to draw
        scenes of ‘Historical landscape, the subjects being original designs from poetick
            passages’.<sup> </sup> An example of this kind of work by Porter survives (fig. 1), in a
        picture that appears as though it could be inspired as much by Welsh settings as by literary
        prompts. By July 1799, Porter, Underwood, Francia and others were in Wales in order to
        sketch not from poetry but from real life.</p>

    <p>While art might have taken him to Wales, Porter’s tour is also a highly readable account of
        several weeks on the road, characterised by a lively narrative voice, and sharply observed
        local detail. At times he finds fault with his surroundings, or loses patience with the
        unsettled weather, or with his companion, in passages that emphasise the social and material
        aspects of travel in what Porter called his ’6 week Zig Zag of Human Incidents’ (f. 127).
        Much of his journey was made by foot; taking a chaise from Northwich to Macclesfield, Porter
        reflected that he and Underwood were now travelling ‘more like Gentleman tourists than dirty
        Artists’ (f. 105).</p>

    <p>Porter’s visual and painterly approach to place comes to the fore particularly in sections on
        the sublimity of Cader Idris and Snowdonia, where he described scenes that ‘untill [sic]
        this moment [he] had never beheld’, and which ‘human talents’ were ‘far beneath the power of
        conveying’ (f. 33). He writes energetically about and with close attention to the dramatic
        landscapes he encountered on the tour: Pont Aberglaslyn appeared ‘by far the most barbaric
        or apparently uncivilized Morsel of Wales I had yet beheld’. He noted it as a kind of ‘Hell
        on Earth’, ‘deep as the Devil’s dwelling’ – before stopping to draw it. Several pages later,
        Aberglaslyn’s stony perpendicular gives way to ‘dark thick mist’ (f. 61) on the summit of
        Snowdon, the view ‘undistinct’, ‘dreamy’ or ‘glazed’ with ‘a sort of supernatural film … so
        ingeniously stirred up with the clouds that, by degrees, earth and air became the same: and
        seemed as tho’ these two elements were going to exchange places’ (ff. 61-5).</p>

    <p>The sketches he made on this tour are not known to have survived, except for four small
        drawings – all of people – contained within the manuscript notebook. However, several
        watercolours by Thomas Underwood, now held at the Tate, including two paintings of
        Caernarfon (figs 1 and 2) and several unnamed coastal and mountain scenes, may well date
        from the 1799 tour.</p>

    <p>In 1799, Porter was on the verge of high profile success in his art work; he would shortly go
        on to produce the vast panorama <i>The Storming of Seringapatam</i>, which caused a
        sensation on being exhibited at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1800.<sup> </sup> Work such
        as this and other military panoramas led directly to his appointment around 1805 as
        Historical Painter to the Russian Tsar, Alexander I – a precursor to diplomatic roles in
        Russia, the Middle East and later Venezuela. Without claiming too much for Porter’s Welsh
        tour, and the experience of sketching outdoors in landscapes that he found spectacular, it
        undoubtedly took place at a crucial moment in his career as an artist. </p>
