    <h2>Philip Yorke, Erddig (1743–1804)</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">
        
        One could be forgiven for thinking, on reading the opening sentence of Philip Yorke's earliest extant letter to Pennant, dated 3 December 1776, that an account of <a href="/doc/0024">Yorke's north Wales tour of 1766</a>, mentioned therein, would follow (<a href="doc/1355">1355</a>). The letter in fact gives very little away about that journey, other than providing important information about Yorke's fellow-travellers, among whom was Sir Brownlow Cust, future brother-in-law to Yorke. Whereas the diary of the tour careers at pace through the first day, 13 August 1766, as Yorke travels from his home at Erddig near Wrexham to Rhuthun, enthusing over the 'fertile Vale' of the river Clwyd, and spending his evening dancing at the assize ball, the letter stations him firmly in the border country of east Denbighshire. This contemporary landscape is quickly transformed into that of the contested medieval terrain of the Welsh border. Yorke explains the stern laws governing the crossing of Offa's Dyke, the etymology of the place name 'Bromfield', or the multiple divisions of the commot of Maelor Gymraeg by Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his successors, painstakingly supporting his text with annotations.</p>
        
        <p>Yorke's interest in the genealogies of the medieval rulers of Powys, within whose territories his ancestral home of Erddig was located, is in evidence throughout his correspondence with Pennant. Attempts to establish the subject of a monument at an unspecified church (possibly that of Gresford) leads to a lengthy list of the supposed subject's ancestors, Yorke touching, not for the first time, on the story of Gruffudd and Llywelyn ap Madog, wards to John, Earl of Warren 'by whom, they were dispossess'd, and dispatched privately' (<a href="doc/1357">1357</a>, <a href="doc/1355">1355</a>), and tracing the line down to Owain Glyndwr. A letter of 30 November 1777 (<a href="doc/1358">1358</a>) shows him excusing himself for not having yet communicated 'the Succession of Bromfield' to Pennant, a suggestion that the latter made use of Yorke not only for offering corrections to his proofs in advance of the publication of the first volume of <i>A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</i> (1778) (<a href="doc/1356">1356</a>) but also for first hand information to be included in his publications. A letter dated 13 November 1778 is addressed from Netherhall, Cumbria, seat of Humphrey Senhouse, whom Pennant had visited on his second Scottish tour. Yorke writes in some detail of altars and stones found at nearby Maryport, providing copies of the Latin inscriptions, and introducing the material as 'such things as have been found in and near the Camps since you were in this Country' (<a href="doc/1354">1354</a>). Almost two decades later, released from the duties of caring for 'the younger parts of my family' who are now 'dispersing', we find Yorke still answering questions for Pennant: struggling to write with 'chilled' fingers, he communicates what he knows about the Edwards families of Chirk, Cefn-y-Wern and Plasnewydd (<a href="doc/1362">1362</a>). At around the same time, he is able to direct Pennant to the work of the Oswestry-based antiquarian John Reynolds, using it to provide details about the marriages of the six daughters of Robert Davies of Gwysaney, even though he thinks Reynolds's work but 'an ordinary performance' (<a href="doc/1364">1364</a>).</p>
        <p>By the 1790s, Yorke was deep into his own genealogical researches, and quickly taking possession himself of the subject of 'the Welsh tribes' (<a href="doc/1361">1361</a>). 'You once thought of doing something with them, yourself', he writes to Pennant, before firing off a string of questions, to which he hopes the latter's 'writer' may be permitted to 'copy answers'. The delving into details about lesser-known figures is explained by reference to Pennant's comprehensive work on Welsh history: where the stories of great men are exhausted, 'some thing might still be had from those of a second rate', Yorke reasons. His strong sense of indebtedness to Pennant when, in 1795, he was able to publish <i>The Tracts of Powys</i>, 'rather the Memoir than the History of Powys' (<a href="doc/1364">1364</a>), was signalled by the dedication of that volume to Pennant 'as to one, by whom our Antiquities have been best understood, and best illustrated' (<a href="doc/1363">1363</a>).</p>
        
        <p>Also worthy of mention in introducing Yorke's letters to Pennant are his several references to another notable antiquary, Pennant's 'constant friend &amp; companion in travel', John Lloyd of Caerwys, affectionately dubbed 'Bloddy' by the squire of Erddig. Yorke clearly had access to Lloyd's library when, in a 1777 letter to Pennant (<a href="doc/1357">1357</a>), he cited a marginal note by Lloyd to David Powel's <i>Historie of Cambria, now called Wales</i>. Yet, the Caerwys rector's method of writing 'from his pate, and good memory, [and refusal to] set on a Chair, and Consult Books' was clearly a source of frustration to Yorke (<a href="doc/1361">1361</a>). Closing this letter, he reiterates the connection between Lloyd's Cwmbychan family and Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, brought to public notice through Pennant's <i>A tour in Wales</i>, but rather whimsically digresses into a commentary on the Welsh love of ancestry. In spirit, this conclusion touches on his love, in evidence elsewhere in this correspondence, of writing squibs (<a href="doc/1360">1360</a>) or 'modern Rhime, and of the worst Age' to 'fill a dull Page, instead of ancient learning' (<a href="doc/1358">1358</a>). This pastime led to the publication in 1798 of a short book of <i>Crude-ditties</i>, anticipating by a year Yorke's greatest contribution to learning, <i>The royal tribes of Wales</i> and, like the latter, printed by John Painter of Wrexham.</p>
