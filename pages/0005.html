    <p>For the Welsh-born writer Hester Piozzi (1741-1821; fig. 1), the 1780s was a decade of
        transition in personal and creative terms. Her first husband, the wealthy brewer Henry
        Thrale, died in 1781; amid considerable controversy she married her second, Gabriel Piozzi,
        in 1784. Her life as Hester Thrale had been shaped first by motherhood and then, partly
        through the influence of Samuel Johnson (a frequent presence in the Thrale households from
        1765 onwards), by her roles as a literary hostess and prolific diarist. Much of London
        society, and particularly Piozzi’s Bluestocking friends and acquaintances, felt there was
        something scandalous in her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi, an Italian Catholic singer and music
        master who had once taught her daughters. Rumours circulated that she had married for lust,
        and that for his part Gabriel Piozzi was only interested in her money.<sup>1</sup> The
        marriage resulted in lasting estrangement from close former friends such as Frances Burney
        and even Samuel Johnson.</p>

    <p>Her new life as Hester Piozzi brought her a certain amount of financial independence, along
        with a newfound hostility towards England; Italy and Wales would grow to be more important
        to her as a result. It also gave rise to a writing career that would see Piozzi become a
        hugely innovative author of nonfictional prose. The death of Johnson in 1784 prompted her to
        publish first <i>Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson</i> (1786) and then <i>Letters to and
            from the Late Samuel Johnson</i> (1788), two commercially successful, if controversial,
        works that established her as a literary figure in her own right. The extended continental
        honeymoon the Piozzis had undertaken between 1784 and 1787, during which she produced the
        Johnson biography, also yielded a major work of travel writing, <i>Observations and
            Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey Through France, Italy, and Germany
        </i>(1789). All three of these books reflected the anecdotal style with which she became
        identified, and which would also feature in her later groundbreaking works on synonymy and
        history.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 1789, Piozzi, in the company of her husband and youngest daughter, made a
        tour of Scotland, travelling up through York and Durham to Edinburgh, across to Glasgow and
        on to the Highlands, before returning down the coast through Carlisle and Liverpool to
        north-east Wales. Piozzi had embarked on this tour at virtually the same moment that
            <i>Observations and Reflections </i>was being published and may have had her Italian
        travels of some five years earlier much in mind as a result. Continental comparisons abound
        in the record she kept of the Scottish tour: the countryside around Whitby is ‘coarse as
        Westphalia’ (f. 4r); she records grapes ‘growing wild as if at Florence or Genoa’ (f. 5v)
        near Durham; on crossing the Scottish border, where the country ‘changes its Appearance
        gradually, and the manners fade away visibly’, she is reminded of ‘Vanvitelli’s Aqueduct at
        Caserta’ (f. 7r). Edinburgh calls to mind Paris – the city’s poor women ‘have much of the
        French Manner’ (f. 7v) – and Glasgow is ‘wholly like a Continental Town’ (f. 11r).</p>
    <p>For all its personal or anecdotal style, Piozzi’s <i>Observations and Reflections</i> shows
        her engaging in serious reportage, commenting for example on the national condition of
        France in the mid-1780s, and on topics such as commerce, trade, government and society.
        Different impulses frame the Scottish tour, which, despite the immediate political context
        of July 1789, makes only glancing references to contemporary events (see for example her
        comments on ‘the Curse of Despotic Governments’ at f. 3r). By contrast, Piozzi’s letters
        from Scotland offer an alternative narrative, written from a much more political perspective
        that rarely surfaces in the tour. These letters (and to a lesser extent her diary,
            <i>Thraliana</i>) write and rewrite multiple accounts of the same place: specific points
        and phrases echo across different manuscripts. On 21 July she describes the scene in
        sociable Edinburgh to her friend Samuel Lysons as one in which ‘everybody is talking of
        Famine and Bloodshed, and filling each other’s Heads … with the most tremendous
            Uproar’.<sup>3</sup> That almost nothing of this turmoil makes it into the written tour
        perhaps reflects late eighteenth-century expectations of travel writing as detached and
        authoritative, rather than ephemeral and of the moment.</p>
    <p>At least in theory, Piozzi was free to take any approach she chose in the Scottish tour
        because it remained unpublished (though in practice it may of course have been read in
        manuscript by a select audience). But why did she apparently have no plans to publish this
        work, especially given that her previous books had sold so well? Perhaps Johnson’s Scottish
        tour – which she explicitly mentions only once, at f. 10v – loomed before her, but Piozzi
        herself suggested that there were other reasons. Surviving correspondence shows that her
        Scottish excursion was surrounded by an element of ‘celebrity’ appeal. Her progress north
        was being followed in the <i>World </i>newspaper (edited by her acquaintance Charles Este):
        on 9 July 1789, the paper informed readers that ‘Mrs. Piozzi, who … writes so well of her
        travels, that we wish her to travel most of her life, is now about to enter Scotland’, while
        on 31 July came the announcement ‘Mrs. Piozzi is gone to Glasgow’.<sup>3</sup>
    </p>
    <p>Piozzi knew that the <i>World </i>was reporting on her Scottish tour, and complained sharply
        to Sophia Byron, whom she believed had fed the information to Este. On her return, she
        confided the following thoughts to her diary: </p>
    <p>When People press me to write my <i>Tour of our own Island</i> in good Time! they say it to
        ensnare me: was I to act according to such Advice I should deservedly lose the little Fame I
        have already acquired.<sup>4</sup>
    </p>
    <p>Piozzi’s Scottish tour is a lively, wide-ranging and highly readable work. Her sense that
        publishing it would be detrimental is perhaps not easy for us to understand today, but it
        reflects the tight conditions in which women writers published (or did not) in certain
        genres – travel writing among them.</p>
