    <h2>William Owen (Pughe)</h2>

        The Merioneth-born William Owen (from 1806, Pughe) moved to London in 1776, and was a member of the London-Welsh Gwyneddigion society from 1783. The first volume of his Welsh-English dictionary appeared in 1793, by which time he was known to Pennant, as the extant correspondence between the two men proves. Pughe was also involved in the various literary publication projects of the Gwyneddigion, and edited the three volumes of the <i>Greal</i> periodical (1795, 1799 and 1818).</p>
        
        <p>The eight letters preserved are dated between 1789 and 1794, and are all, with one exception, written by Pennant to Pughe. They show that Pennant used the latter to sound matters of interest to him in London as he prepared his book on the capital, first published as <i>Of London</i> in 1791. The topics are by no means limited to questions of Welsh interest: Pennant asks about docks along the Thames, the new canal from Bromley which enters the river, and the fate of the old Navy Office. A prompt answer from Pughe [23 April 1789] addresses the queries in detail, evidently much to Pennant's satisfaction, for he included significant sections of this letter verbatim in <i>Of London</i>. A letter of July 1789 shows that Pennant, for a while at least, passed the proofs of the book by Pughe, but finding 'so much time lost' in the process decided to forgo the practice, 'except on difficulties'. He was able to repay Pughe by sending on to him a list of subscribers to his dictionary, all Denbighshire and Flintshire men, and promising to 'take care of those [subscriptions] I get' [2 August 1790]. When the second part of the dictionary, a work 'looked for with impatience' [7 May 1791] appeared in 1794, Pennant asked Pughe to send six copies to him via the bookseller and publisher, Robert Faulder [4 October 1794]; he also subscribed for six copies of Iolo Morganwg's <i>Poems, lyric and pastoral</i> (1794) [2 July 1791]. He was less enthusiastic about the project to trace the Welsh Indians, or Padoucas –all the rage among the Gwyneddigion in the early 1790s – and cited advancing years, excessive engagements and efforts at 'lessening my literary businesses' as his reason to refuse to support the plan [11 April 179[?2]].</p>
        
        <p>The final letter in the collection shows Pennant again asking for favours, this time to find a teaching post for one of the daughters of his deceased 'companion in travel', John Lloyd, Caerwys, and to recommend a child to the Welsh School in Gray's-Inn Lane [4 October 1794]. As one point in a series of requests and rebuffals, this illustrates the uncomfortable relationship which Pennant had with his fellow-Welshmen, whose 'neglect', he wrote in July 1791, 'cannot give them any clame [<i>sic</i>] from me' [2 July 1791].</p>
