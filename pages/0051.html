<p>This anonymous tour of 1794 is remarkable as a rare example of an extensive pedestrian tour of Scotland. The writer, accompanied part of the way by a companion, arrives at Carlisle from London in early August, from where he proceeds across the border towards Glasgow, Loch Lomond and the central Highlands, before travelling north-east to Inverness, Morayshire and Aberdeen, where the journal abruptly terminates; an itinerary at the end of the text notes the places visited and distances travelled. On crossing the Spey, the writer refers to his ‘Native River’, but there is little other identifying information. As well as frequent references to classical authors such as Tacitus to describe the ‘primitive’ inhabitants of the Highlands, the writer makes significant borrowings from Pennant in his notes; like those of Pennant his interests reflect the broad pre-disciplinary scope of late-eighteenth-century travellers, combining remarks on antiquities, landscape, ethnography and industry, including an extensive description of the mills at New Lanark. The writer’s politics are explicitly unionist: at the battlefield of Culloden he writes that ‘It may be safely pronounced that the Issue of that Rebellion was highly beneficial to Scotland’; he is similarly whiggish regarding the ‘salutary’ proscription of the MacGregors. However the Highland sections of the tour are also elegiac in tone, reflecting the ambivalence of British improvers towards the decline of Highland culture and, in particular, the putative martial spirit of its inhabitants. Besides classical comparisons to ancient Germanic tribes, the main vehicle for expressing this sense of loss is through James Macpherson’s Ossianic poetry, which appears both in the journal’s epigraph and in a description of Kilchurn Castle on Loch Awe. The journal as a whole reflects the status of the manuscript as well as the published Scottish tour in the late-eighteenth century, as genres concerned with the articulation of national origins, histories and contemporary conditions upon the times and places of the traveller’s itinerary, but which did not always find comfortable resolutions to the ideological dilemmas of the recent past or projected change.</p>
