    <h2>John Lloyd, Hafodunos and Wigfair (1749–1815)</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">
        
        Known within his circle as the 'Philosopher', a role to which Pennant in one of the letters presented here stakes his claim as a 'second' (<a href="/doc/1374">1374</a>), John Lloyd of Hafodunos and Wigfair, Denbighshire, held the interest of a prosperous landowner in antiquarian and genealogical pursuits, book and manuscript collecting, geology and botany. A justice of the peace and, briefly, MP for Flintshire, he was also interested in the potential of mineral exploitation and in agricultural innovation. Although a substantial collection of letters to and from Lloyd is preserved at the National Library of Wales, they include none from his pen to Thomas Pennant, and the following collection comprises eleven addressed to him by Pennant. The later letters testify to Pennant and Lloyd's shared concerns as upholders of law and order in north-east Wales, with Pennant offering his firm support to Lloyd over the latter's handling of a riot at Denbigh in April 1795 (<a href="/doc/1374">1374</a>). Alongside this, they offer us a glimpse of the two men's neighbourliness, with Pennant offering his thanks for Lloyd's attentions to his son David and his bride on their marriage in December 1793 (<a href="/doc/1373">1373</a>). A letter of 1775 (<a href="/doc/1371">1371</a>) turns to a subject much courted by both men: the experience of witnessing earthquakes on their estates in north Wales. Pennant's first publication was an account of an earthquake in April 1750, which appeared in the Royal Society's <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>; Lloyd, aptly dubbed by Pennant 'my dear Pupil' (<a href="/doc/1368">1368</a>), followed suit, presenting to the Society in April 1781 'an account of an earthquake at Hafodunos, Nr. Denbigh ... in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks', and yet another in a letter to Banks in November 1782.</p>
        
        <p>The letters of the early 1770s portray the two men's fellowship as antiquarians and Pennant's sense of embarking on a mission to explore 'our welch antiquities' (<a href="/doc/1366">1366</a>, 10 March 1771). An important part of the project is to engage with the visual portrayal of Wales's antiquarian heritage, by seeking collections of drawings of monuments from known collectors such as the archivist Thomas Astle, and looking through the lists of the successful print publisher Samuel Buck (or his brother Nathaniel) (<a href="/doc/1368">1368</a>, 21 May 1771). Two letters of April 1773, the earlier (<a href="/doc/1369">1369</a>) written at Gothurst in Buckinghamshire, but evidently posted further north, in Northampton, the later (<a href="/doc/1370">1370</a>) at Chester, sketch out Pennant's homeward journey from London. (An account of this journey, taken in the opposite direction, was published in 1782 as <i>The journey from Chester to London</i>.) Sending via Lloyd his remembrances to companions left behind in London, the antiquarians Edward Haistwell and Richard Gough (<a href="/doc/1369">1369</a>), he offers a list of subjects of interest along the route, inviting Lloyd to 'add y<sup>r</sup> remarks &amp; sketch the arms' and asking him to look up details on his behalf at the British Museum (<a href="/doc/1370">1370</a>). In these letters, we see Pennant nestling within a fraternity of antiquarians, among whom his 'Pupil' Lloyd was an important player.</p>
