    <p>In her posthumously published autobiography, Eliza Dawson (later Fletcher) writes: ‘In the
        summer of 1786 my kind father indulged me with an excursion to the Highlands of Scotland.’
        While Fletcher recalls her tour as one of the formative episodes of her young life, she is
        less sanguine about her written record of it: </p>
    <p class="quote">
        <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-left"/> I was then sixteen; and for my
        father’s amusement I kept a journal of each day’s adventures. This was afterwards
        transcribed in a book, which held a favoured place in my father’s book-case, and yet
        now-a-days a very ordinary girl of sixteen would be ashamed to write so bald, so affected,
        and so absurd a narrative of a six-weeks’ tour in Scotland; I could sit down and laugh at it
        from beginning to end, there is so much attempt at fine writing in it, a thing never thought
        of now, I presume, by a girl of sixteen. It abounds in the bad taste of the time; it is a
        sort of “sentimental journey.”<sup>1</sup>
        <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"/>
    </p>
    <p>Over two centuries later, the very aspects of the journal which Fletcher enumerates as it
        failings, now recommend it as a hugely valuable text: a rare insight into the lifeworld of
        ‘a very ordinary girl of sixteen’ written in an engaging literary voice, and a compelling
        example of the late-eighteenth century manuscript tour. Dawson and her family complete a
        version of the ‘Petit-Tour’ popular throughout the period, reaching as far west as
        Inveraray, and north to Dunkeld, where they visit the Duke of Atholl’s famous Hermitage and
        so-called Ossian’s Hall. While that attraction, like Dawson’s literary models, resonates
        with what she might have later dismissed as ‘the bad taste of the time’, they also serve as
        useful reminders of the dominant cultural status of sentimentalism in the
        late-eighteenth-century, bolstered by the widely read work of Laurence Sterne, Henry
        Mackenzie and James Macpherson, the supposed translator of Ossian’s ancient poems. </p>
    <p>The Dawsons’ tour was at least partly motivated by Eliza’s desire to visit her schoolfriend
        Miss Meliss, now Mrs Stewart, who had recently married the cotton manufacturer and burgh
        reformer George Meliss of Perth. This context is reflected in Dawson’s descriptions of
        philanthropic manufacturing schemes around the Tay, including the mills at Stanley. In
        addition to moments of antiquarian speculation which echo those found in Pennant’s two
            <i>Tours</i> of Scotland, Dawson also presents moral reflections on the rugged Highland
        landscape, which reflect her characteristic erudition and draw on long-running debates
        surrounding issues of improvement and the theological and aesthetic significance of mountain
        scenery. Dawson’s accounts of incidents on the road offer further opportunity for encounters
        in the sentimental mode, but also reveal the shaping role of practicality and accident in
        the experience of travel, often omitted from the period’s published tours. </p>
