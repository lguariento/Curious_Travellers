    <p>In August 1808, Hester Piozzi recorded a visit from her daughter, Sophia Hoare (née Thrale,
        1771-1824), in her diary: </p>
    <p class="quote">
        <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-left"/> Mr and Mrs Hoare have been here on a short Ten-day Visit, and are gone with Cecy Mostyn to
        make the fashionable Mountain Tour of N: Wales:– The Ton Folks <i>do</i> so now o’ Days;
        that they may say next April in London, at what a <i>Distance</i> they pass’d their Summer
        from the Metropolis.<sup>5</sup> <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"/>
    </p>
    <p>The sarcastic slant of this entry suggests two things.
        First, it reflects the different attitudes to place, and perhaps particularly to Wales, held
        by Piozzi and her daughter. By 1808, Piozzi had long been committed to life in north Wales,
        spending much of her time at Brynbella in Tremeirchion, north-east Wales, the house she had
        built with her second husband, Gabriel Piozzi (fig. 1). She was apparently not easily
        tempted away: in 1795, Sophia Thrale had written to Gabriel Piozzi, inviting the couple to
        visit her at Cheltenham on one of their journeys to Wales:</p>
    <p class="quote">
        <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-left"/> My Mother seems impatient to set out for Wales; why cannot you take Cheltenham in your way?
        it would make very little difference and we should be so happy to see you – for my Sister
        not being yet returned, we could accommodate you with the greatest ease – I have never
        mentioned it to my Mother, because I know she thinks every hour not spent at Brinbella [sic]
        is lost time…<sup>4</sup> <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"/>
    </p>
    <p>Second, Piozzi’s<i> </i>comments hint at the difficult relationship she had with her four
        daughters, which despite the cordiality of Sophia Thrale’s 1795 letter, never fully
        recovered from her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi. Thrale’s 1808 visit to Wales was partly a
        postmarital visit to her mother, delayed from after her wedding to the banker Henry Merrik
        (or Merrick) Hoare (1770-1856) the previous year. Hester Piozzi had not attended the
        wedding, and the newlyweds visited Henry Hoare’s family afterwards, rather than
            Sophia’s.<sup>3</sup>

    <p>By the summer of 1808, Hoare
        was an experienced home tourist who had also travelled through, and written about,
        Derbyshire and the Lake District.<sup>2</sup> However, the framework and logistics of the
        domestic tour often make it difficult to isolate one region or nation from another, and
        Hoare’s account of her travels in July/August 1808 shows how wide the definitional borders
        of the Welsh tour can be: the first section lingers in Oxford, giving a close account of
        places visited and objects and artworks encountered there. From Oxford the Hoares travelled
        north and west, stopping at Warwick and Ellesmere, before reaching Brynbella. Both at this
        point and on her return journey Hoare gives a lively portrait of the Piozzi’s home, which
        remained a sociable hub both for gentry neighbours and touring friends despite the declining
        health of Gabriel Piozzi (d. 1809).</p>
    <p>From Brynbella the Hoares travelled west along the coast to Snowdonia, Sophia Hoare
        reflecting on the nature of the roads, inns, landscape, local people and the Welsh language.
        At Caernarfon she notes, ‘I made a Drawing of some sort, surrounded by a Number of little
        dirty Children all chattering welch – indeed we had heard nothing Else from the lower
        Classes since we left Brynbella, and it was only now &amp; then that the Post Boys or the
        Maids at the Inns could understand us or us them’ (f. 10). Her comments, which read ‘like
        observations on a remote people’, represent what Jenny Uglow describes as experiences that
        ‘widened rather than bridged [many tourists’] sense of a gulf between classes’.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>Class-based distinctions between tourists and local people are visible elsewhere in the
        social fabric of this tour. While in Wales the Hoares frequently meet (sometimes by chance)
        eminent local figures, from the agricultural improver William Maddocks – famous for creating
        ‘Traeth Mawr’ or ‘The Cob’, an embankment across the estuary near Porthmadog (fig. 2) – to
        the wealthy landowner and MP Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, and Richard Colt Hoare, half-brother
        to Henry Hoare. Travelling conditions, too, mark differences of class. The Hoares cover
        Wales by coach, while Sophia Hoare’s younger sister, Cecilia Mostyn, rather more intrepidly
        travels across north Wales on her black horse (f. 10v).</p>
    <p>Social connections structure this tour throughout. The final leg of the Hoares’ trip includes
        a visit to Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby at Llangollen, with access to the Ladies
        secured by a letter of introduction from Hester Piozzi (f. 20r). Her celebratory account of
        Plas Newydd reads as a highlight of her travels, which conclude with a border itinerary
        (Shrewsbury, Ludlow) before returning to Oxford and London.</p>
