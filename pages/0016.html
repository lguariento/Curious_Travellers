    <p>In the summer of 1805, the 22-year-old Cornelius Varley sat in the Vale of Llanllyfni, with
        Snowdon some seven miles to the east of him, and contemplated the sky. Visiting Wales in the
        middle of a prolonged rainy spell, Varley, a watercolourist and maker of scientific
        instruments, was trying to understand the workings of the clouds he could see moving and
        shapeshifting over Snowdonia. He turned to a theory of electricity in order to do so,
        proposing that clouds, and rain, were governed by a system of charged electrical
        particles.</p>

    <p>Varley was born in Hackney in 1781, a younger brother to John Varley (1778-1842), who as an
        artist would turn out to be the better-known of the two men. The early death of their father
        resulted in John Varley being apprenticed to a painter, while Cornelius Varley was raised by
        and in turn apprenticed to his uncle, Samuel Varley, a watchmaker, maker of scientific
        instruments and scientific lecturer. Varley describes this background, and his precocious
        skill in making his own scientific apparatus – especially lenses and microscopes – in the
        early part of this undated tour-memoir. By 1811 he would have invented and patented the
        graphic telescope, a drawing aid in the form of a device that magnifies the subject to be
        drawn and projects it onto paper.<sup>1</sup>

    <p>Varley’s 1805 visit to Wales was one of several Welsh tours he made just after the turn of
        the century in the company of his brother and other artists, including Joshua Cristall
        (1767–1847) and William Havell (1782-1857), almost certainly in order to sketch landscapes
        from real life. Little information survives about the Varley brothers’ 1802 tour but
        drawings and watercolours dating from this year, including of Llangollen, Barmouth and Conwy
        Castle, suggest a typical itinerary for this period. Several undated sketches, including a
        view of Llanberis (fig. 1) that shows Cornelius Varley’s spare and sensitive view of
        landscape, almost certainly date either from this tour or those that followed it in 1803 and
        1805.</p>

    <p>Varley’s grey washed ‘Carnarvon Castle’ (fig. 1), which is clearly dated 1802, is
        characteristic of many of the images he produced in this period: naturalistic and
        meteorological in its depiction of atmospheric conditions, with a curiously flattened
        quality to the building and parts of the background. The capacity of clouds and mists,
        especially as they interact with light, to thicken, obscure or empty out the subject of a
        painting is a frequent theme in Varley’s work. His interest in light and weather is evident
        in his 1803 tour, which includes an episode on Cader Idris in which he encounters a Brocken
        Spectre in the company of Joshua Cristall: </p>

    <p>Varley’s explorations on and off the page of landscape and weather in Wales directly coincide
        with attempts by other observers to understand atmospheric science, among them the chemist
        and meteorologist Luke Howard, who classified the clouds in a lecture of 1802.<sup>2</sup>
        In the early nineteenth century, Howard was also attempting to explain atmospheric phenomena
        by means of electrical theory. When Varley returned to Wales in 1805, the science of clouds
        in relation to electricity was much on his mind. This tour represents a different kind of
        visit from the earlier tours in several ways: this time Varley travels alone, and in extreme
        weather (‘the whole season was so rainy that in most places I was the only traveller’ – f.
        2r). He was also on a scientific expedition as well as a painting one: ‘having been familiar
        with the known Electrical experiments I was better prepared &amp; more at liberty to observe
        and understand what I saw’ (f. 2r). </p>

    <p>Varley’s Welsh tour is by no means a typical home tour for the period. Part retrospective
        travelogue written some time after the events it describes, and part autobiography, it is
        also an example of the scientific first-person narrative, often slanted towards
        (self-)experimentation, employed by contemporaries such as Thomas Beddoes and Humphry
            Davy.<sup>2</sup> The text reproduced in this edition is presented with a four-page
        manuscript Appendix, which is closely related to the expanded account of atmosphere and
        electricity Varley published in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> in 1807. In this account
        clouds appear structured by electricity; ball-like particles, each one orbited by
        electricity is what holds them together, he suggests. ‘The remarks which I offer’, he later
        wrote in the 1807 published article, ‘are founded on actual observations, which any person
        may easily verify, and on the known and admitted laws of electricity.’ While his researches
        in prose aim at rational explanation, the emptied scenes of his most enigmatic Welsh
        watercolours suggest no such easy resolution.</p>

    <p>Note on the source text:</p>

    <p>The manuscript source for this edition is a fragmentary autobiographical text in Cornelius
        Varley’s hand. In the source text, Varley frequently leaves space on the page in the page in
        place of standard punctuation. Aiming at a readable text, this edition substitutes full
        stops for spaces on the page where the text may otherwise be difficult to follow. This
        edition also reproduces a further manuscript as an appendix: this text, titled ‘A Theory of
        the Atmosphere shewing the formation of Clouds’ is a draft of the scientific paper Varley
        published in 1807 as ‘On Atmospheric Phænomena: particularly the Formation of Clouds’ (see
        explanatory notes on the text for further details of the relationship between these two
        versions). </p>
