    <h2>John Lloyd, Caerwys (1733–93)</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">
        
        Fêted by Pennant in his preface to the first volume of <i>A tour in Wales</i> as 'my constant companion in these excursions', and in a letter following his death as 'my right hand in welsh antiquities my constant friend &amp; companion in travel: to whom we all owe much' (<a href="/doc/1168">1168</a>), John Lloyd (1733–93), curate and subsequently rector of Caerwys in Flintshire, was central to Pennant's tours of his native country. Twelve letters between the two are extant, eight from Lloyd, and four from Pennant, dating from around 1777 to the year of Lloyd's death. An additional three documents in Lloyd's hand contain information pertinent to Pennant's tours. Lloyd's letters display his on-the-ground knowledge of historical sources, as in the case of letter <a href="/doc/1378">1378</a>, where he painstakingly extracts and considers material from manuscript 'Compacts' dating to the period after the wars of Owain Glyndwr. Other letters display his erudition as a genealogist [<a href="/doc/1380">1380</a>; <a href="/doc/1382">1382</a>;  <a href="/doc/1383">1383</a>]; his insight into archaeological remains in Flintshire, which he interprets alongside lexicographical, toponymal, and historical information [<a href="/doc/1381">1381</a>]; or his knowledge of medieval performance practices in Wales and their contemporary usage in informal – but fiercely contested – 'eisteddfodau' [<a href="/doc/1385">1385</a>]. We catch a glimpse of his hearty, warm personality in a letter of June 1777 [<a href="/doc/1379">1379</a>], where he asks to be excused for belatedness in fulfilling a task on Pennant's behalf, characterizing himself as 'rather Idle &amp; indolent by nature', and apt to be too much involved in clerical duties and 'Farming schemes'.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout Lloyd's letters, there are clear indications that they were written expressly for the purpose of enriching Pennant's <i>A tour in Wales</i>. Lloyd offers advice on how to employ his discoveries in print: his observations on 'Compacts', he suggests, would be suitable for inclusion in Pennant's published work as 'a Handsome paragraph' on the subject of justice in the Welsh principality after Glyndwr's days. Conversely, the material on the 'Datceiniaid or Vocal Performers', he counsels, would best be left alone 'till you come to Meirionydd or Caernavonshire'. Pennant's debts for material included in the first volume of the first edition of <i>A tour in Wales</i> are summed up in a letter of 6 January 1778 [<a href="/doc/1384">1384</a>], where he thanks Lloyd 'for y<sup>r</sup> kind labor in correcting the welsh of my Tour', and expresses his hope that the latter approves 'the tenor of my ramble', flagging up in particular the section on Owain Glyndwr. Before further parts of the tour were published in 1781 and 1783, Lloyd was able to offer information on the losses sustained by the Welsh legendary hero, Llywarch Hen, at the battle of Rhiwedog, near Bala [<a href="/doc/1386">1386</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Further letters from Pennant relate to parish concerns: writing from London, he expresses concern about distress in his native county on account of food shortages [<a href="/doc/1387">1387</a>], and fears about the possibility of fever being spread into Flintshire from Anglesey and Caernarfonshire by vagrants [<a href="/doc/1388">1388</a>]. In both cases, Lloyd can assist Pennant in securing the best possible outcome for the residents of the county.</p>
        
        <p>Also included in this collection of correspondence is a letter from Pennant to offer condolences to John Lloyd's family upon his death in May 1793 [<a href="/doc/1393">1393</a>]. The acerbic comments added in the hand of Angharad Llwyd, Lloyd's daughter, throw a shadow over the two men's relationship, perhaps prompting us to consider issues of generosity and appropriation as we reflect on the relationship of patron and servant and examine this correspondence alongside Pennant's publications.</p>
