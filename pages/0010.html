    <p>Frances Crewe’s (1748-1818) account of the tour of north Wales she made in the summer of
        1795, accompanied by her daughter Emma, suggests that she was both a curious and a
        well-prepared traveller. Crewe, a socialite and Whig hostess (fig. 1) who divided her time
        between London and Crewe Hall in Cheshire, refers to Thomas Pennant on numerous occasions as
        an authority on the places she visits. But she also records a variety of unexpected
        encounters ‘in a foreign Country’ that lead to a sense of shifting perspectives. Her tour
        presents an engaging narrative voice, with a seemingly open and candid approach to places
        and people, and a novelistic flair for relating situations and events.</p>

    <p>Crewe had travelled
        widely before visiting Wales in 1795 (this was also not her first visit to Wales). She had
        previously written extensively about travel: the diary she kept in Paris in the mid-1780s
        (published in 2011) covers people, politics, current events, and all aspects of fashionable
        life. Her reaction to Cader Idris early on in the tour – ‘Seariously this Mountain beats
        every thing I ever saw since I was a Child, in Italy!’ (f. 133v) – is characteristic of her
        lively style; it also shows that her responses to Wales exist within comparative and
        continental contexts. Her comments on Welsh ‘Maners’, language and music read like real-time
        observations on the road but (sometimes complex) references within the text to Pennant, and
        to Edward Jones’s <i>Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards</i> (1784; see for
        example f. 141v), place Crewe’s tour in relation to a wider network of existing knowledge
        about Wales in the late eighteenth century. They also show her developing or adding to this
        knowledge, albeit in the relatively private space of the manuscript journal. (Some, though
        not all, of these references can be found in the margins of the tour, or on blank facing
        pages, sometimes in a different hand – something that may suggest later commentaries or
        reflections on Crewe’s Welsh experiences in 1795.)</p>
    <p>Crewe’s especially positive depiction of Pennant offers new evidence for the ongoing
        reception of his tour and his contemporary reputation in the 1790s. Her comments on the
        medieval church at Corwen simultaneously praise Pennant as an architect of Welsh history and
        topography and reflect with some humour on the experience of those who follow in his
        footsteps as amateurs by comparison: </p>
    <p>We have had a bright Sunshine all this day &amp; before we left Corwen we walked to look at
        the Church &amp; Church yard, they are boath [sic] much the handsomest we have seen yet,
        &amp; they Contain antiquities of very great importance, to so accurate &amp; minute an
        observer as M<sup>r</sup> Pennant but to <sup>mere </sup>Clod Pole travelers, who come after
        him like ourselves who have no minds Eye like his, nothing but General Enthusiasm, without
        patriotism to [illegible] <sup>inspire</sup>! to us, very much is lost! (f. 143r)</p>
    <p>Crewe’s textual encounters with Pennant and Jones almost certainly happened by design. This
        tour is, however, notable for another and this time unplanned encounter, with the Lichfield
        poet Anna Seward, famous since the early 1780s for a series of odes on national
            affairs.<sup>1</sup> Seward was also touring Wales in the summer of 1795; her tour would
        later yield one of her best-known poems, ‘Llangollen Vale’, published in 1796. Crewe’s
        entertaining description of meeting Seward by chance at a Barmouth inn (f. 139v) gives us a
        brief ‘behind the scenes’ insight into Seward’s more formal account of Wales in her poetry
        and correspondence, in what feels like a particularly unscripted moment.<sup>2</sup>

    <p>Note on the source text:</p>
    <p>The manuscript source is written in Frances Crewe’s mostly clear hand. Her account of Wales,
        which is part of a larger notebook, begins at f. 131, therefore the pagination in this
        edition starts from this point. The opening pages of Crewe’s tour have been digitised by the
        British Library: https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-welch-journal</p>
