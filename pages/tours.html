                    <h2>Manuscript Tours of Scotland and Wales</h2>


                    <h3>From Thomas Pennant to the Tours</h3>
                    <i>by Elizabeth Edwards and Alexander Deans</i>

                    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">When Thomas Pennant's landmark <i>Tours </i>of
                        Scotland and Wales began to appear in the early 1770s, they brought renewed
                        attention to questions of history and antiquarianism, landscape and
                        topography, science and industry, local and national cultures, and the
                        languages of the British Isles.<sup>1</sup> This edition presents a
                        selection of previously unpublished tours, made after Pennant had opened up
                        travel writing to the so-called peripheries of these islands.</p>

                    <p>Pennant's <i>Tours</i> were synthetic texts, pieced together from journeys
                        undertaken (in the case of the Welsh tour especially) over many years, and
                        from information supplied by numerous collaborators. The method behind the
                        compilation of the tours can be traced in detail in his correspondence, much
                        of which is now available in the digital edition of 'The Letters of Thomas
                        Pennant'. On the evidence of the manuscript tours presented in this edition,
                        however, Pennant's approach was not typical of the travellers who followed
                        him. Tim Fulford's recent description of Thomas Beddoes' account of
                        travelling while experimenting with oxygen in the 1790s offers an apt model
                        for thinking about manuscript travel writing in this period: 'If he has a
                        narrative structure, it is that of the intimate missive narrating the
                        quotidian varied by a journey: what he does shapes how he
                            writes.'<sup>2</sup> The tour as a sequence of daily events on the road
                        that give rise to journal-like narratives is the basic form adhered to by
                        the writers in this edition, though they frequently embrace Pennant's
                        far-reaching scope and concerns. </p>
                    <p>The dominant mode of travel writing for our period was an empirical and
                        neutral descriptive style known as 'voyages and travels'.<sup>3</sup> Travel
                        writing is, however, a composite genre which can, and does, address all
                        subjects in virtually any style. This is perhaps especially true of
                        unpublished travel writing from the period, which presents us with texts
                        composed by tourists who left little or no other known literary work,
                        sometimes with a diary-like intimacy rarely seen in published tours. </p>

                    <p>Why manuscript tours? Working with historical travel writing may mean
                        adjusting our expectations of the genre, to a moment in which it signified
                        very differently. Travel was a prestigious literary genre, and it was very
                        widely read (it can probably be placed only behind religious writing and
                        fiction in popularity). Unpublished tours can therefore be taken as
                        participating in wider conversations about politics and culture, place and
                        current events. They would also have found contemporary readerships in the
                        enduring scribal culture of the eighteenth and early-nineteenth century,
                        circulating within a select audience of relatives and friends.<sup>4</sup>
                        Manuscript tours are, however, often obviously shaped by print culture:
                        elements such as title pages, internal divisions or sections, indices, or an
                        authoritative and seemingly impartial mode of address reminiscent of
                        published tours, will all be found in unpublished texts. </p>

                    <p>There are of course almost as many forms of travel writing as there are
                        individuals writing travel, but breadth and variety may apply particularly
                        to manuscript tours, in which no constraints of an expected readership or of
                        the marketplace need apply. Shaped by both manuscript and print cultures,
                        unpublished tours bridge textual worlds, but they are also often messy and
                        unpredictable, presenting specific material challenges (illegible words and
                        passages, cancellations or missing sections). Manuscript tours of Wales and
                        Scotland also present distinctive challenges that derive from national
                        contexts. The Enlightenment natural and antiquarian concerns that animated
                        Pennant's <i>Tours</i> continue to provoke reflection in the work of
                        unpublished travellers, drawing attention to the complexities of manuscript
                        travel writing as a live and fluid genre that inflected as well as emulated
                        literary fashions more generally. This is particularly evident in
                        travellers' encounters with their fellow subjects in the Gaelic-speaking
                        Highlands and Islands. James Macpherson's supposed translations of Ossian
                        emerge in this edition as the dominant imaginary in travellers' responses to
                        the Gaels and their culture. But if English translations of Macpherson and
                        others are often allowed to speak in these texts on behalf of the Highlands
                        and their inhabitants, then there are also moments of disruption and
                        recognition that suggest the polyvalence of the travel account's
                        characteristic mode of encounter. </p>

                    <p>While tour journals are frequently ordered around recurring sites and
                        itineraries, many of the journeys in this edition are framed by a strong
                        sense of internal difference; in 1802, Mary Anne Eade was conscious of being
                        'on the borders of another country, tho' not another island' (f. 19v) on
                        entering Wales. Scotland notably offers further internal divisions: many
                        travellers opt to cross the Highland line into the Gaidhealtachd, or venture
                        west to the Hebrides. The circuit of the central Lowlands and southern
                        Highlands, which Pennant described as the 'petit tour of Scotland', seems to
                        have remained the dominant route in the period, but the attractions of
                        Fingal's Cave and Staffa in particular also exert a strong draw on many of
                        the writers represented here. In Wales, northern tours, in which tourists
                        travel along the inland A5 route and/or along the coast road, feature most
                        often in the archive, but virtually all of the Welsh texts in this edition
                        are structured by encounters with castles, country houses, industrial sites,
                        and the sublime landscapes of Snowdonia or, for those who venture further
                        south, the picturesque of the Wye Valley and mid-Wales, or the coastal towns
                        of the west and south.</p>


                    <h5>Aims of the Manuscript Tours in Scotland and Wales Project:</h5>


                    <p>The opening up of print archives via digital means has made many published
                        works of travel easily accessible. Manuscript tours – and the kinds of
                        knowledge being produced or processed in them – remain, however, a
                        logistical problem, widely distributed as they are across research libraries
                        and archives. Several manuscript tours have recently been edited and
                        published (in print and digital formats), but the diverse body of texts from
                        the period made available by this edition may enable us to contest current
                        understandings of the genre of travel writing.<sup>5</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>In selecting tours for this edition, range and subject matter have been key
                        factors, as have issues of class and gender. Tours by labouring-class
                        figures such as Edward Williams ('Iolo Morganwg') and Cornelius Varley
                        counteract the frequently middling- and upper-class purview of travel
                        writing in the period, while aiming at gender parity brings genuinely new
                        voices into the field. Bibliographical records for the period suggest that
                        no more than around thirty tours by women were published before 1800; this
                        edition will significantly extend the number of known and available tours by
                            women.<sup>6</sup> The usefulness of Welsh and Scottish tour narratives
                        in mapping historical change within these nations has long been recognised,
                        and so this selection offers a sense of the tour's own history as an
                        adaptable and allusive literary form, as well as an invaluable source of
                        insight into time, culture and place. </p>
