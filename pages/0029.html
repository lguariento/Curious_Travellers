    <p>George Capper’s tour, made in May 1802, offers a view of south Wales through the eyes of a
        clergyman. The Cambridge-educated Capper (1767-1847) came from a Suffolk background, but was
        perhaps drawn to Wales for family reasons – in 1802 his uncle James Capper, an army officer
        and meteorologist who spent much of his career in India, was living in Cardiff [fig. 1],
        where this tour begins. Capper, who had become the rector of Little Blakenham near Ipswich
        in 1794, writes very much as a typical leisured tourist. He records antiquarian and
        geographical scenes of interest (castles, churches, monuments, ruins, bridges, canals), and
        notes the rapid industrial changes taking place in the south Wales valleys – including the
        vast wealth being accumulated by individuals such as Richard Crawshay, ironmaster at
        Cyfarthfa, the largest ironworks in Britain in the 1790s (f. 7r).</p>

    <p>From Cardiff the tour moves west and north, to Merthyr and Pontypridd and then from
        Abergavenny to Brecon. Capper jots down comments on the quality of the food and
        accommodation, and their cost, while an incident involving a theft at Crickhowell (f. 11r)
        nicely illustrates the rapid turnover of guests at Welsh inns and the often crowded nature
        of the tourist experience. Suspecting that an Irish servant has stolen his watch, Capper is
        able to trace and follow the inn’s previous customers in a way that suggests the
        distinctiveness and visibility, rather than anonymity, of parties on the home tour.</p>

    <p>Capper reflects on the layered nature of Welsh landscapes throughout his tour, balancing the
        ‘wearisome tract of barren Mountain’ (f. 8r) he finds at the heads of the valleys with
        thoughts of the mineral resources (read: riches) that lie beneath. Travelling westwards into
        the rural topography of Carmarthenshire, his attitudes towards landscape take on different
        resonances. Capper displays his knowledge of Wales in wider eighteenth-century culture
        through a visit to John Dyer’s Grongar Hill [fig. 2], but in this section the social
        commentary side of his tour takes a sharpened political turn. Capper’s opening paragraphs on
        Cardiff praise the virtues of refined retirement, but no such society seems to him to be
        possible in turn-of-the-century Carmarthenshire, where a decade of wartime and scarcity,
        alongside a genuine diffusion of revolutionary principles in Wales, has led to the tangible
        emergence of ‘That equalizing spirit … that has gone forth in the world’ (f. 17r). Instead,
        Capper imagines a near future in which the almost-feudal relationship between the Welsh
        people and local gentry families will be replaced by a modern one ‘rid … of all superfluous
        respect for their superiors’ (f. 17r). ‘I think great doubt may be entertain’d whether they
        will be either the better or the happier for their change of manners’, he concludes.</p>
