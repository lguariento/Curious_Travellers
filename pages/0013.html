    <p>Mary Anne Eade's <i>Journal of a tour</i> recounts a journey made in the spring of 1802, in
        the company of her husband William. Beginning in London, Eade's itinerary takes in the
        midlands, north Wales, Dublin, and County Wicklow, before returning to north London.
        Sympathetic to Wales throughout, this tour is characterised both by an awareness of internal
        British boundaries – Wales is 'another country, tho' not another island' (f. 19v) – and a
        joyful sense of celebration. Harp music heard at the border town of Oswestry prompts Eade's
        elation at the idea of crossing into 'that land of wonders I had so long wished without hope
        to contemplate'.</p>
    <p>Eade came from a London merchant family background, and belongs among the many home tourists
        writing in this period who are not known to us today beyond their surviving manuscript
        accounts. Although she therefore has no profile as a writer beyond this work, her narrative
        is articulate and readable, full of engaging detail and novelistic moments. Her skill in
        recounting events on the tour is well-illustrated by sections set in Llangollen [fig. 1],
        where the Eades are served by a French waiter (f. 22r) and where an expedition to Dinas
        Brân, the castle overlooking the town, takes an entertaining and melodramatic twist. Eade is
        similarly appealing on the interior life of the home tourist, representing the displacements
        of travel as a disturbed emotional state in a passage on waiting for the Irish ferry at
        Holyhead:</p>
    <p class="quote">
        <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-left"/>my mind during this interval naturally dwelt on
        all those dear friends from whom the boundless ocean was so soon to separate me … the idea
        of having the rolling sea between us was so new &amp; so strange as to appear to me quite
        frightful (f. 33v). <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"/>
    </p>

    <p>Later in the tour, the material challenges of travel – dirt, discomfort, poor weather – lead
        her to wryly acknowledge, 'I am not a thorough traveller yet' (f. 57v).</p>

    <p>Eade's tour is particularly notable for its account of Ireland, in which she outlines the
        sociable and touristic contexts of turn-of-the-century Dublin before making a tour of
        Wicklow to the south. Her account includes well-known picturesque locations such as the
        River Dargle and the Powerscourt estate [fig. 2]. But Eade also sets these scenes, which she
        describes as 'formed to be the abode of quiet retirement' (f. 43v), alongside the 'late
        rebellion' – the United Irish uprising of 1798, which had recently devastated this region.
        Just four years later, the events of 1798 have become incorporated into the tourist trail;
        their trauma part of and visible in the landscape.</p>

    <p>Fragments of internal evidence about Eade's life and situation make this a rich tour for
        still other reasons. Pleasure is, predictably, an important part of a trip made 'in quest of
        new beauties', but the personal elements and emotional narratives of this text particularly
        stand out. A short preface, written by her husband, and dated March 1803, frames this tour
        and announces that Eade (b. 1778) has since died. The manuscript consequently becomes a
        powerful personal memorial, an object of grief, as well as an account of a journey that,
        aside from the text, 'now appears like a pleasing vision, impress'd indeed strongly upon the
        imagination, but without reality' (f. ii). It was also written as a personal document to a
        younger sister, Eliza (b. 1780), in response to her (untraced) tour of south Wales – not
        just an extended postcard, then, but also a form of gift exchange. Eade explicitly
        recognises that writing with a particular recipient in mind shapes both the literary aspect
        of her tour and her actual experience of travel on the road: 'I finish my little journal of
        a most delightful tour with regret because in finishing it I conclude a long imaginary
        conversation with you; which has possessed many charms for me' (f. 74r).</p>

    <p>Note on the source text:</p>
    <p>Aside from William Eade's short preface, the manuscript source is written in Mary Anne Eade's
        generally legible hand, with relatively few emendations. At over 23,000 words – partly
        because it also features an Irish tour – this text is one of the longer Welsh manuscript
        tours included in our edition.</p>
