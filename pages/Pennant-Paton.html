    <h2>The Correspondence of Thomas Pennant and George Paton, 1773–1798</h2>
    <i>by Alex Deans</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">In late 1770, with <i>A tour in Scotland 1769</i> approaching publication, Thomas Pennant
        received a letter from the Edinburgh Customs Clerk, George Paton. The son of a bookseller,
        Paton (1720-1807) was a prominent intermediary in Scottish antiquarian and collecting
        circles, and a committed bibliophile. His letter of 1770 initiated a correspondence that
        continued throughout the planning, composition and revision of Pennant’s second <i>Tour</i>
        of 1772, and came to an end with Pennant’s death in 1798, having produced over 200 letters.
        The two men would meet while Pennant was at Edinburgh during his second tour and share an
        excursion to nearby Rosslyn, but in contrast to most of Pennant’s Scottish correspondents,
        Paton’s primary role was not as a guide to his own locale, but to the social, logistical and
        textual resources needed to add scope and accuracy to Pennant’s travel narrative. What
        Pennant praises in one letter as Paton’s ‘communicative disposition’, rendered him
        instrumental as a point of access both to antiquarian and topographical circles, and to
        collections in the Advocate’s Library of Edinburgh, allowing him to provide Pennant with
        printed and manuscript both ancient and contemporary. Paton’s bureaucratic connections
        allowed him to ease the transmission of physical objects — including letters, but also
        drawings and specimens — between Scotland and Wales. The correspondence is also littered
        with occasionally clandestine interventions into the advertisement and reception of
        Pennant’s works, offering insight into not only the knowledge-work behind the composition of
        the <i>Tours</i>, but the practicalities of bringing them into print, and the responses they
        provoked from contemporary readers. While some letters from Paton to Pennant survive in the
        Warwickshire County Record Office and National Library of Wales, an almost complete run of
        Pennant’s letters to Paton is held in the former collection of the Advocates Library at the
        National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, with the latter forming the backbone of the
        selection presented here.</p>
