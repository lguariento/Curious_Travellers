        On a 'ramble in search of health' in May 1797, Thomas Pennant wrote of his arrival 'at the hospitable mansion of Bevere the mansion of our friend Nash' (<a href="/doc/1193">1193</a>). Treadway Russell Nash, who had inherited his family's estates upon the death of his two older brothers in 1756 and 1757, arranged for the rebuilding of a recently acquired house near Worcester, to become known as Bevere House. Pennant had previously stayed there in the summer of 1782 (<a href="/doc/1020">1020</a>) and, as the letters sent him by Nash show, was there sometime before 1777, when Nash remembers him placing a copy of Thomas Twyne's <i>The breuiary of Britayne</i> on one of his shelves (<a href="/doc/1304">1304</a>). Nash, having taken the degree of DD in 1758, continued to work as patron to family vicarages in Worcestershire, whilst also pursuing an interest in the history of the county. It is fair to assume that it was a joint interest in history and antiquities which cemented the relationship between him and Pennant.</p>
        
    <p>Of the four extant letters edited here, all written by Nash, three date from 1777. Their central interest is the evidence for Owain Glyndwr's presence in Worcestershire during 1405. According to the French chronicler, Enguerrand de Mostrelet, Glyndwr travelled into the county from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, and faced the army of Henry IV for several days, both forces, however, refraining from engaging in combat. Pennant's interest in the history of Glyndwr was to reach a peak during 1777 as he prepared a 'tolerably worked up' account of him for publication the following year in the first volume of <i>A tour in Wales</i> (<a href="/doc/1384">1384</a>). In 1774, Nash had undertaken the work of preparing the manuscripts of the antiquaries Thomas Habington (1560–1647) and William Thomas (1670–1738) for publication as <i>Collections for a History of Worcestershire</i>. What is probably the earliest of the letters to Pennant (<a href="/doc/1304">1304</a>) shows him thanking the latter for information about Glyndwr, who featured in his own commentary on the remains of an encampment at Woodbury Hill in the parish of Great Witley in the second volume of the published <i>Collections</i> (1782). The discussion in which Nash engages over three letters shows him comparing a quotation from Monstrelet's chronicle about the Worcestershire meeting between Glyndwr and Henry IV, provided by Pennant, with his own 'remembrance of the Spot where I suppose the Event hapned [sic]'. When his plan to examine the location of Glyndwr's Woodbury Hill camp was hampered by bad weather in November 1777 (<a href="/doc/1306">1306</a>), he resorted to giving Pennant 'the best Information I can from the report of others'. Suggesting that Pennant 'draw [his] own Inferences' from the facts thus given, Nash is himself clearly inquisitive, often asking questions suggestive of intriguing possibilities about the movements of Henry's army or his possible use of other camps in the area, such as those at Wasal Wood or Kinver Edge, or offering an opinion on the advantages of the Woodbury Hill camp's location for the 'rebel' Glyndwr's efforts to escape the king's forces.</p>
        
        <p>Whilst the greatest significance of this correspondence lies in the conversation about Glyndwr, there are other matters of interest in its record of an acquaintance clearly cherished by both men. Nash warmly invited Pennant and his wife to Bevere, suggesting in July 1777 that the latter might stay there in the company of his own wife, Margaret, whilst Pennant undertook a journey south along the course of the Severn (<a href="/doc/1305">1305</a>). Nash probably visited Downing, too: in July 1777 he 'threaten[ed]' Pennant with a visit, and in May 1788 he asked for instructions for travelling northward there from mid Wales where he was called by 'some business', requesting in particular information on 'whether it is easy to bring a Chaise that road' (<a href="/doc/1305">1305</a> and <a href="/doc/1307">1307</a>). He showed solicitude for Pennant's son David when, in May 1777, a visit to Harrowgate in county Durham was ordered for the benefit of his health (<a href="/doc/1305">1305</a>); and he was sensitive to the 'contempt' Pennant's eight- and nine-year-old children, Sarah and Thomas, might feel in the presence of his own two young grandsons (<a href="/doc/1307">1307</a>). Pennant and Nash were further drawn together by their friendship with the botanist John Lightfoot, upon whose unexpected death in 1788 Nash suggested that Pennant write a memorial sketch (<a href="/doc/1307">1307</a>). He was able to provide information about Lightfoot's place of birth and family members. A reference in the same letter to Pennant's being refused permission to copy a picture in the possession of one of the London-based learned societies shows Nash's indignation at behaviour of such 'narrowness &amp; peevishness': the societies 'are only Trustees for the publick', he writes, '&amp; an author of your established merit has a right to every thing that the learned world can furnish'.</p>
