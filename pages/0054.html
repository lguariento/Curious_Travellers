    <p>In 1780, Jacob Pattisson, a medical student at Edinburgh University, embarked on a tour of Scotland accompanied by his friend, William Lister. Pattisson and Lister reached as far west as Mull, Staffa and Iona in the Inner Hebrides, before returning to the mainland and proceeding up the Great Glen to Inverness and Morayshire, making their way back to Edinburgh down the east coast and through the central belt. David Allan has described Pattisson’s correspondence with his friend Benjamin Strutt, as being ‘blessed with the <i>gauche</i> self-confidence of young men intensely aware that they lived in an age of Enlightenment.’<sup>1</sup> Something similar might be said of Pattisson’s Highland Tour, which combines an often self-satirising personal narrative, with the topographical and social description typical of contemporary printed tours of Scotland. Pattisson’s conspicuous erudition is somewhat undercut by the journal’s epistolary conceit, which styles individual sections as letters addressed to his sister, Elizabeth, in their native Essex, providing moments of reflection and humility. Both Pattisson and Lister were involved in the clubbable intellectual world of Enlightenment Edinburgh, with Pattisson holding presidencies of the Speculative, Royal Medical, and Physical Societies at the time of his early death in 1782, following which the members of the three societies erected a monument to his memory in Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Pattisson’s Tour represents a crucial point in the history of manuscript journals of Highland travel, less than a decade after the publication of Thomas Pennant and Samuel Johnson’s highly influential accounts of the Hebrides in 1774 and 1775 respectively, and before the rapid expansion of leisured tourism in the late 1780s and 1790s. Pattisson clearly acknowledges Johnson as a main influence, although references to Joseph Banks’s account of Staffa, published in Pennant’s <i>Tour in Scotland 1772</i>, suggest he was at least familiar with that work. Pattisson’s connections with Johnson are strengthened by encounters (though not always cognizant) with figures who had hosted or crossed paths with Johnson and Boswell during their tour, such as Lachlan Macquarrie of Ulva and his family. Moreover, Pattisson clearly shares Johnson’s scepticism towards James Macpherson’s <i>Ossian</i>, resulting in a somewhat mean-spirited episode of Ossianic imitation at Scallastle on Mull. As Allan notes however, Pattisson was clearly fascinated with the Enlightenment theory underpinning Macpherson’s distinctive literary aesthetic. Ossianic parody was a feature of Pattisson’s aforementioned correspondence with Strutt, just as it is of his Highland Tour, and to an extent that suggests a familiarity with, and perhaps admiration of the material, despite his doubts regarding its authenticity.</p>
        <p>If Pattisson finds common ground with Johnson in his attitude towards Macpherson however, his politics reflect the Scottish Enlightenment milieu that Johnson held in such contempt; a point of difference on which Pattisson is silent. Pattisson’s deep-seated whiggishness runs somewhat counter to Johnson’s High Toryism, particularly in relation to recent Highland history and Jacobitism, though this is tinctured with sympathy for forfeited individuals or families. However Pattisson presents himself as a staunch Whig in his views on Highland society, culture and clanship as a whole. Some encounters and conversations aside, Pattisson’s descriptions of Highland manners and lower-class Gaels often resort to familiar tropes of indolence, martial pride, and clan loyalty, rather than anything more insightful or sympathetic. Despite this, his accounts of convivial Highland hospitality and characterization of his hosts in Mull and Argyll are often lively and affectionate. Beyond the Highlands, Pattisson records memorable descriptions of industrial sites, including bleach works, mills, and, in particular, the huge Carron iron works near Falkirk. Also of particular interest is a chance meeting with the Welsh mineral engineer and geologist, John Williams. Pattisson’s voice as a self-conscious product of the Scottish Enlightenment, mediated through his perspective as an English tourist in the Highlands, combined with an eye for characterisation and detail, render his one of the most entertaining and substantial manuscript tours of Scotland produced in the period.
