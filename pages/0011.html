 <p>Catherine Hutton (1756-1846) was one of the more perceptive and thoughtful writers of Welsh tours at the end of the eighteenth century. Her observations, as sharp as they are sympathetic, stand out for their easy elegance and their readability. The accounts of her travels in north Wales are preserved in National Library of Wales MS 19079C, a neat, hand-written volume with a carefully laid-out title page:</p>

 <p>Like many title-pages, it doesn’t quite tell the whole story. From the style of the handwriting and the ‘1842’ inscription at the bottom, it looks as if it has been drawn up several decades after the years of the letters it describes. The volume also includes, as an appendix, extracts from reviews and letters from friends responding to the publication of Catherine Hutton’s novels, a piece about female writers from the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> of 1821, and an obituary of Hutton, who died in 1846. The bulk of the volume, however, is indeed a copy of the letters from Wales, and these are written in an earlier form of Hutton’s hand. Various marks, deletions, insertions and notes suggest that it was her attempt at pulling all four tours together, perhaps in preparation for their serial (and partial) publication in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> in the 1810s.</p>
 <p>This rather complicated manuscript history matters because tours are in and of themselves historical documents, and can bear witness to lives and landscapes which have changed for ever; there is a world of difference between 1800 and 1840, and even between 1796 and the 1810s, and it helps to consider what kinds of editorial interventions may have taken place between the writing of the original correspondence (which has not been located) and this particular recension. Hutton was an assiduous letter-writer all her life, and her three novels (<i>The Miser Married</i>, <i>The Welsh Mountaineer</i>, and<i> Oakwood Hall</i>) all draw on the epistolary form. It seems likely that the text preserved here is close in tone, style and content to the letters received by her brother Thomas (and possibly other recipients) over the course of the Huttons’ journeys through north Wales, but that some revisions have been made, and that the more personal comments usual to such letters— on friends, or family, or current affairs—have been removed. What is clear, however, is that the manuscript copy was itself edited, revised and considerably truncated for publication in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> between 1816 and 1819. This in itself justifies the inclusion of Hutton’s text in a corpus of unpublished tours in Wales; the nature of the revisions is discussed in more detail below.</p>
 <b>
        <i>Catherine Hutton: writer and traveller</i>
    </b>
 <p>Born prematurely in 1756 to the Birmingham bookseller and historian William and his wife Sarah, Catherine Hutton was, according to her father, ‘perhaps the smallest human being ever seen’, but grew up healthy enough in a comfortable town house in New Street; the family also built a country house, Bennett’s Hill, just north of the city at Washwood Heath. William Hutton published the first history of Birmingham in 1781, and moved in Dissenting circles, attending the New Meeting house where Joseph Priestley preached. Catherine describes Priestley’s visits to their home, and, like her father, wrote a vivid account of the 1791 Church and King riots, when not only Priestley’s house, library and workshop were destroyed, but the properties of seven others—the Huttons amongst them. Both the New Street town house and Bennett’s Hill were looted; the latter was burnt to the ground.</p>
 <p>Sarah Hutton was an invalid over a long period, and her daughter, besides caring for her, took on many of the household responsibilities. The family visited Buxton in attempts to improve Sarah’s health; and in the summer of 1787 they undertook a journey to Aberystwyth, a small coastal town just beginning to find itself on the tourist itineraries. Three of Catherine’s letters from this visit were published in a later memoir compiled by her cousin Catherine Hutton Beale, and (judging from Beale’s treatment of later letters) are likely to have been quite heavily revised before publication. William and Catherine Hutton would return to north Wales four more times after Sarah’s death in 1796, and both father and daughter wrote accounts of their journeys. William’s were published as <i>Remarks Upon North Wales</i> (1803); Catherine’s appeared as a series of ‘Letters’ published in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> between 1815 and 1819. The <i>Monthly</i>’s editor, Sir Richard Phillips, was a friend and correspondent of Catherine Hutton, and in 1821 she was included in the list of ‘twenty four ladies of pre-eminent talents as writers in various departments of literature and philosophy’ (a list from which Jane Austen, whom Hutton admired, is conspicuously absent). Besides her three novels, Catherine Hutton also published a <i>Tour of Africa</i> (1819–21), a compilation of travel narratives by other writers. Recent work on Hutton as a novelist, letter-writer and tour writer can be found in <b>Further Reading</b>, below.</p>
 <p>Comparison between the published letters and the manuscript shows a range of different revisions. The published 1796 Tour is very close to the printed version, with the significant omission of only a few paragraphs in which Hutton describes a particularly irritating fellow-guest at their hotel in Barmouth. Thereafter the changes become more significant, as the 29 letters written out over 138 pages are condensed into a mere 18, often conflating accounts where the Huttons have taken the same road more than once: moreover, while the 10 MS letters of the 1796 tour fit comfortably into 9 printed letters in the <i>Monthly</i>, the equally extensive tours of 1797, 1799, and 1800 are squashed down to a mere three apiece. This has implications for the published tour as historical witness: for example, sections of Letter 16, dated ‘Caernarfon 28 August, 1800’ (which appeared in the <i>Monthly</i> for September 1818), appear in the manuscript version as Letter 23, dated from Ruthin a week earlier. One notable loss is the conflation of two separate journeys from Caernarfon through Bettws Garmon to Beddgelert; the first of these, fascinating because Hutton is deliberately following in Pennant’s footsteps and cites him at length, leaves only the ghost of an impression in the published version, and omits the references to Pennant altogether (1799 Tour, MS Letter 13; MM (June, 1818, 387-99). It also omits Hutton’s typically droll (and self-ironizing) comment on her preparations for the next stage of the journey, the notorious ‘rock road’ linking Beddgelert and Pont Aberglaslyn to the main coach road on the coast: ‘Having armed myself with an unusual quantity of excellent cold roast beef, I rode to Pont Aber Glaslyn, and entered upon the celebrated road from thence to Tan y Bwlch.’</p>
 <p>Publication in the <i>Monthly</i> certainly altered Hutton’s voice, shifting the emphasis to objective, factual observations in the style of other published tours, and slicing away many of the elements that give her narrative its particular life and tone. These include details of her own struggles with the experience of travel in wild Welsh weather (‘surely such petticoats were never seen!’), admissions of fatigue and illness, and spontaneous expressions of judgement or enthusiasm: the only woman wearing cotton (rather than the more laudable native wool) at a market in Cerrigydrudion in 1797 is described in the manuscript as ‘a dirty trollop, who seemed the refuse of another country’; in the published version she is a ‘dirty creature’. There are memorable pen-portraits, such as that of the landlady of the Cross Foxes at Llanarmon, or of the courteous and intelligent boatman, Richard Williams of Cwm-y-Glo. Occasionally a brief paragraph half-opens a door into another life, such as that of the Irish emigrée with whom Hutton and her father share the guest-house in Caernarfon in 1799, the summer of the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-left:2rem">I have made another acquaintance, directly opposite. Pity for her forlorn situation attaches one to her. She is an unmarried woman, turned of thirty, of a noble family in Ireland, whom the troubles there have driven into Wales. She has not been in any personal danger; but her brother’s house has been plundered by the rebels, and his domestics threatened with instant death. Such is her terror at these proceedings, that she declared to me she would not have slept another night in his house for a thousand guineas; and I am told, that here she sleeps in her cloaths. She is at Caernarvon without either friend or servant. The people here have a notion she is a little deranged. This, however, is not the case. She appears to me not only rational but sensible. She is so grateful for my attention, and her manner is so affecting, that sometimes I can hardly refrain from tears. (Letter 19, 1799)</p>
    </blockquote>
 <p>Hutton is also concerned with the impact of tourism on the culture and economy of Wales, restricting her ‘good opinion of the people of Wales to those who have had little intercourse with the English’ and noting the visible and rapid differences made by ‘swarms’ of tourists in recent years: ‘the roads are improved; the farms are raised; money is introduced; and the people are rapacious.’ A clergyman tells her that ‘the English Mountain-hunters’ have ‘made his country so dear that he cannot afford to live in it’, and she worries about the treatment of horses, driven to exhaustion on the new, frantic post-roads. (Letter 12, 1797)</p> 
 <p>Welsh landscapes bring out some of her finest qualities as a writer, and she is in turn vivid, passionate, and wryly humorous about her own responses to the various scenes encountered on the road, and to views of mountains in particular. She found the ‘view from the hill above Harlech […] so stupendous it shook my whole frame’, and took evening walks from the guest house in Caernarfon to gaze at the Snowdon range ‘with awe, almost with reverence’ (Letter 5, 1796; Letter 12, 1797). For someone who suffered as badly as Hutton did from vertigo, mountains are as fascinating as they are ‘forbidden’; and even riding along coach-roads cut into steep hillsides can be enough to force her to dismount and walk. The Huttons travelled on horseback, with Catherine riding pillion; they were accompanied by a servant, John, who figures in some of William Hutton’s poems on their Welsh tours. Hutton notes that this ‘mode of travelling places us in rather equivocal light at inns’, where guests in carriages, who could be charged much higher rates, were rather more welcome than riders on horseback, or, even worse, pedestrians (Letter 29, 1800).</p>
 <p>Hutton’s experiences in north Wales fed directly into her second novel, <i>The Welsh Mountaineer</i> (1817) which, making ample use both of letters and of travel narratives, develops Wollstonecraftian theories about female liberty by exploring two sharply contrasting women’s lives, one metropolitan, physically weakened and trammelled by social mores, and one fresh from the mountains of Meirionydd, wilder, more energetic, if socially more naïve. There is no doubt where Hutton’s sympathies lie. Another appeal of these tours, then, beyond their intrinsic merit, is the way they can be read in direct conversation with other texts, from Hutton’s own novels (written as she was revisiting these Welsh tours for publication), to her father’s <i>Remarks Upon North Wales,</i> a witty, more succinct, and more cerebral account of the same roads travelled. Accounts of north Wales by other writers in this digital corpus, both women and men, offer further material for comparison; and it is also intriguing to think of Hutton covering much the same ground as the young J.M.W Turner, at much the same time.</p>
 <h4>Itineraries</h4>
 <p>Catherine Hutton appears to have done much of the planning, and researched the itineraries of these journeys. In 1796 the Huttons were based at Barmouth, travelling there from Birmingham via Shrewsbury, Montgomery and Mallwyd and returning via Bala and Llangollen. Excursions from Barmouth included a memorable journey to Harlech castle, and a brief glimpse of Tan-y-Bwlch. In 1797, 1799 and 1800, they stayed at Caernarfon, travelling via Llanrwst and Conwy, and making shorter journeys out to the Lakes of Llanberis, Anglesey, Clynnog and Beddgelert. In 1799 they returned through the mountains via the ‘rock road’ to Tan-y-Bwlch. Father and daughter seem to have felt comfortable making some of their explorations of the area separately: William Hutton was a tough and avid walker; in 1801, aged 78, he would become the first person to walk the length of Hadrian’s Wall. He certainly climbed Snowdon and crossed the sands of Traeth Mawr on his own; but (though her use of first person singular and plural can be misleading) Catherine seems to have headed up from Barmouth to Harlech accompanied only by John the servant, and perhaps followed Pennant to Llyn Cwellyn by herself. She too was capable of covering impressive distances, writing to Thomas after her trip to Beddgelert:</p>
 <blockquote>I hope you are not so much fatigued with my excursion as I was. I was ten hours out, nine of which I was on foot, or on horseback. My stockings were shattered, my feet were blistered, and I was almost ready to prove, according to the opinion of some great philosophers, that man is a quadruped, by crawling on all fours. (Letter 13, 1797).</blockquote>
 <p>Besides the usual types of observations on customs and costumes, language, food, dwellings, and Methodism, the Huttons witnessed two consecutive years of extreme weather conditions, and Catherine’s account describes the aftermath of devastating floods in 1799, and a drought in 1800. She also catches occasional slantwise glimpses of people known better from other contexts in Wales, such as the schoolmaster and poet Dafydd Ddu Eryri, and the writer and vicar Peter Bailey Williams. Above all, what carries her through wind and rain and the everyday setbacks of travel as a tourist is an enduringly positive attitude to Welsh people and Welsh culture: ‘who, that did not deserve reproof, would disparage the country to its natives; or who, that had eyes to see, and a heart to feel, would speak contemptuously of Wales at all’? (Letter 6, 1796)</p>
 <p>There is an intriguing echo here of the well-known ‘Triad’ penned by the Welsh bard Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg, 1747-1826), who happened to be in Beaumaris in August 1799, and was another witness to the devastation of the flood that swept away bridges and livestock, and left the Huttons battered by wind and rain on the road to Abergwyngregyn (Letter 18, 1799). Williams claimed that a true poet required ‘an eye that can see nature, a heart that can feel nature, and a resolution that dares follow nature’. Catherine Hutton—observant, sympathetic and determined— certainly possessed all three.</p>
