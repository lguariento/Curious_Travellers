        Holder of clerical office on the isle of Anglesey and at Aber in Caernarfonshire, Hugh Davies was a reputable natural historian, with a particular interest in botanology. He first met Pennant in late June–early July 1773 ('I have had Mr Hugh Davies of Beaumaris with me for a week &amp;amp; like him much', wrote Pennant to Daines Barrington), and his six extant letters to Pennant display the broad range of interests which bound them together, from antiquarian inscriptions [<a href="/doc/1308">1308</a>, 29 July 1773] and heraldry [<a href="/doc/1310">1310</a>, 4 September 1779], to multiple branches of natural history. Information in Davies's hand, endorsed by Pennant with the year '1775' [<a href="/doc/1309">1309</a>, 1775] is an important source relating to the latter's 1774 journey to the Isle of Man: any journal kept by Pennant has been lost, and Davies was expressly sent back to the island the following year to 'take a second review of its vegetable production', according to Pennant's <i>Literary life</i>. Although botany is the focus of the document (Davies 'observed ... about five hundred and fifty [species of <i>flora</i>]', claims <i>Literary life</i>), the information given in this document extends also to comments about birds ('Stares [starlings] breed in the walls of houses and assemble in flocks as soon as they are able to fly') and marine life, with the economic value of oysters and salmon, and use of molluscs to entrap cod by fishermen on the island, noted. Antiquarian points of interest are also represented, with crosses at Kirk Braddan cemetery, a place 'remarkably full of graves', described.</p>
        
        <p>In a letter written in March 1782 [<a href="/doc/1311">1311</a>, 14 March 1782], Davies offers Pennant his observations on an incident which took place six years earlier, and his conclusions about the migratory habits of the birds involved. The 'many-many thousands' of puffins, razorbills, guillemots and kittiwakes which he found dead on the beach between Criccieth and Traeth Mawr in north-west Wales, he concluded to have been out at sea within 'our own climate', awaiting the moment to complete their journey inland to breed over the summer, when they were struck by a severe January frost. Other letters display Davies's mounting confidence as a botanist, as he questions the perspicacity of John Lightfoot's observations on plants growing near Downing [<a href="/doc/1312">1312</a>, 5 December 1794], or Samuel Dickenson's claims that the 'Anthoxanthum odoratum, Cynosurus cristatus &amp; Festuca ovina' are 'rare plants' [<a href="/doc/1313">1313</a>, 10 August 1795]. The latter are, in Davies's view, 'exceedingly common, and all of rather inferior rank in respect of utility'. It was his excellence as a botanist which led to Davies's election as a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1790 and to the publication, in 1813, of his <i>Welsh Botanology ... A Systematic Catalogue of the Native Plants of Anglesey, in Latin, English, and Welsh.</i>
