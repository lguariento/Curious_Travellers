    <p>Sophia Hoare’s month-long tour of south Wales in July-August 1809,<sup>1</sup>with her
        husband Henry, reads as a trip made mainly out of curiosity and for pleasure. Leaving London
        on the 7<sup>th</sup>July, they travelled to the Wye Valley via Gloucester, taking a boat
        trip down the Wye to Monmouth in a passage that includes a description of Tintern Abbey
        towards evening (ff. 26r-26v). A disappointing expedition to Llantony Abbey follows, in
        which Hoare finds herself unimpressed with the (ultimately abandoned) efforts of the poet
        Walter Savage Landor to develop the site.<sup>2</sup>

    <p>From there, the Hoares turned west towards Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, visiting the
        dramatically-set Carreg Cennen Castle (fig.1) and (by candlelight) its underground tunnels,
        and the small cathedral city of St David’s. Their return via the south coast took them via
        castles and country houses, and to the spectacular cliffside chapel of St Govan’s – a
        medieval pilgrimage site set in a limestone gorge. Both Hoare and her husband sketched on
        this trip; her interest in contemporary art is also revealed by her attempt to find the
        exact point from which Turner had recently portrayed Pembroke Castle (f. 33v). The final
        stretch of the journey took them through the rapidly changing central and eastern coastal
        regions, where Hoare recorded both the beauty of the landscape and the damaging
        environmental effects of the new heavy industries: ‘The Vale of Glamorgan would be beautiful
        but for the Copper and Iron Works the Smoke of which is very unpleasant and so thick one can
        hardly see beyond it’ (f. 41v).</p>
