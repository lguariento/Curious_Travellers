    <h2>The Correspondence of Thomas Pennant and Richard Bull, 1773–1798</h2>
    <i>by Ffion Mair Jones</i>
    <p style="margin-top: 4em;">Numbering 219 letters, the correspondence between Thomas Pennant and Richard Bull spans a
        quarter of a century and gives us an unique insight into a central feature of Pennant's work
        as an author: his extra-illustration of his own published and manuscript texts. Bull, an
        M.P. and passionate collector of printed portraits, had been extra-illustrating James
        Granger's <i>A Biographical History of England </i>between 1769 and 1774: he now turned his
        sights towards the possibilities and potential of Pennant's topographical works for
        extra-illustrators or grangerizers, striking up an acquaintance with the latter from 1773.
        Bull and his mentor Granger were initially interested in the painted copies of portrait
        heads which Pennant had encountered during his second Scottish tour of 1772, and in his
        provision of published engravings from them. The artist who copied the portraits of the
        Admirable Crichton and the Countess of Desmond was Pennant's 'Servant-painter', the
        Llŷn-born Moses Griffith. As the 1770s progressed, Pennant began to adorn the margins of his
        published tours, printed on large paper, with drawings of localities, portraits and coats of
        arms created by Griffith, and this work circulated among a close coterie of gentlemen to
        great effect. Bull gradually earned Pennant's permission to allow Griffith to work for him
        as well as for his master, thus establishing a mutually beneficial relationship which
        resulted in the extra-illustration of a number of Pennant's works, not only topographical,
        but also of natural history and autobiography. Bull's contribution to this arrangement
        ranged from guidance on how to paste prints into the margins of his books (a service
        provided by his daughters, the Miss Bulls) to assistance in 'puff[ing] off' the work of
        Moses Griffith and helping him break into the London market in printed engravings. Bull was
        also tireless in finding prints suited to the extra-illustration in particular of Pennant's
        'opus magnum', his multi-volume 'Outlines of the Globe', a largely 'imaginary' tour covering
        distant lands never visited by the author. The Pennant-Bull correspondence shows how several
        volumes of the 'Outlines' were created with images in mind, with Pennant, perhaps informed
        by his background in natural history, always mindful of the illustrative aspect of his
        literary work.</p>
    <p>This rich correspondence is enhanced by the development of the personal relationship between
        the writers: starting with a brief, business-like note from Pennant in 1773, it evolves into
        a record of the twin tragedies of the loss of a daughter by both families, and of the trials
        of approaching old age. It is a memorable body of letters, offering insights into Pennant's
        character which cannot be found elsewhere.</p>
