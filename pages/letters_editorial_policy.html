            <h2>CURIOUS TRAVELLERS: THOMAS PENNANT AND THE WELSH AND SCOTTISH TOUR, 1760-1820</h2>
            <b>The Correspondence of Thomas Pennant: Methodology</b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> <i>Curious Travellers editions</i> provides an online edition of selections from the
                correspondence of Thomas Pennant. Scattered among various archives and libraries and
                hitherto largely inaccessible to readers, the letters offer crucial insights into
                the creation of Pennant's Scottish and Welsh tours. In a reflection of the scope of
                the tours, they bring together correspondents within the British Isles and beyond to
                discuss subjects as diverse as natural history, the book trade, antiquarianism,
                visual culture and topography. At the same time, the letters offer us a window onto
                the excitements and practicalities encountered by Pennant and his fellow ‘curious
                travellers’. </p>
            <p> The following editorial guidelines were produced by Dr Alex Deans (Research
                Associate), with input from Dr Mary-Ann Constantine (PI), Dr Nigel Leask (Co-I), Dr
                Luca Guariento (Web Developer) and Dr Ffion Mair Jones (Research Associate). </p>
            <h3>Edition Contents</h3>
            <p> Letters between Thomas Pennant and his correspondents are distributed across
                approximately 20 individual repositories, and occur in a variety of manifestations,
                although the majority take the form of holograph letters.
                <a href="https://editions.curioustravellers.ac.uk">
                    <i>Curious Travellers editions</i>
                </a> displays annotated transcriptions of over five hundred
                letters both to and from Pennant, with a range of search facilities and supporting
                editorial material. The focus of the selection is on letters that have some bearing
                on Pennant’s tours, or related matters concerning natural history, antiquarianism,
                or visual documentation. </p>
            <p> Each document has its own individual record in the project database, containing
                metadata (information such as its author and recipient and their locations, date,
                and source). XML tagging records particular areas of interest, such as people and
                place names, books, manuscripts and art works mentioned. Our policy on this is
                explained in more detail later in this document. </p>
            <h3>Basis of Textual Policy</h3>
            <p> While recognizing the importance of reflecting the state of the copy-texts, we also
                aim to produce an edition in which fidelity to the sources is reconciled with
                clarity for modern readers, including the general public, students and specialist
                scholars. </p>
            <p> Our textual/editorial policy is based, with some adaptation and variations, on that
                devised by Dr David Shuttleton for the AHRC-funded project <i>
                    <a href="cullenproject.ac.uk" target="_blank">The Consultation Letters
                of Dr William Cullen (1710-1790) at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a>
                </i>.
                This was influenced by Thomas Keymer and Peter Sabor’s <i>Cambridge Edition of the
                Correspondence of Samuel Richardson</i> (2014), Lars Troide’s <i>The Early Journals and
                Letters of Fanny Burney</i> (6 vols., Oxford University Press, 1988–), and Bruce
                Redford’s edition of <i>The Letters of Samuel Johnson</i> (5 vols., Princeton University
                Press, 1992–4); and David Fairer’s edition of <i>The Correspondence of Thomas Warton</i>
                (University of Georgia Press, 1995). We have also referred to the methodology of the
                <i>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</i>, published by <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/southey_letters/letterEEd.26.about.html" target="_blank">Romantic Circles</a>.</p>
            <p> The XML schema used for our transcriptions is derived from current Textual Encoding
                Initiative (TEI) <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" target="_blank">guidelines</a>. Our general policy
                is to reproduce all of the original letter text, including the original
                paragraphing, punctuation, neologisms, authorial punctuation, contractions,
                abbreviations, superscripts, underlinings, deletions, numberings, symbols,
                marginalia and endorsements. Wherever practicable, this extends to any later
                additions in the form of headings or early cross-referencing notes. Period
                spellings, misspellings, and grammatical solecisms are retained; however, TEI
                &lt;sic&gt;&lt;/sic&gt; tags are used where apparent authorial slips or slips could
                be mistaken for transcription or editorial errors, e.g. in the case of needlessly
                repeated words. Postal addresses and details of franks and stamps are also marked
                up, but enclosures and images are treated at the editors' discretion. </p>
            <p> We do not always reproduce the precise visual appearance of the original manuscripts
                in terms of layout. If any text continues down the side of a page, for example, we
                have treated it as part of a continuous paragraph. While we preserve existing
                paragraph breaks and do not impose paragraphing on a document that lacks it, our
                paragraphs themselves are standardised in being separated by line breaks and lacking
                indentation. We do not retain line or page breaks, as these in general reflect the
                physical dimensions of the original letters and carry little meaning in the context
                of the typed transcriptions. For this reason, words split over multiple lines or
                pages in the original letters have been represented as spelled in the manuscript,
                but with spaces and hyphenation removed. Similarly, ‘catch words’ occurring at the
                bottom of pages where the letter continues to the next side have been omitted. In
                the case of poems or songs, the lineation of the manuscript has been retained. Where
                necessary, editorial notes have been inserted in footnotes at the end of the
                documents, in order to distinguish them from authorial notes. </p>
            <p> Our more detailed policy on particular matters of transcription follows below: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upper and Lower Cases: For letter-headings and words appearing mid-sentence, we
                    reproduce the original use of lower-case and capitals whenever decidable.
                    Pennant and many other eighteenth-century writers use enlarged letters at the
                    start of sentences that are not actually capitals (in particular an enlarged
                    lower-case version of ‘a’ is often employed). For the transcriptions, we render
                    these as full-capitals (i.e. wherever the start of a new sentence is clearly
                    indicated in the text by the use of a full-stop or a dash, then we start the
                    first word with a capital letter). Alternatively, in a number of hands the
                    lower-case letters ‘c’ and ‘s’ in particular tend to appear more enlarged.
                    Unless found at the start of the sentence, these are generally treated as
                    lower-case, but because decisions over whether a letter is a capital or not was
                    left to the discretion of the transcriber there may inevitably be some minor
                    variation of treatment over this matter. </li>
                <li>Disguised Names: Where a name is indicated by a number of dashes (e.g. ‘Mr.
                    F-------’), the exact number of dashes is transcribed. </li>
                <li>Dashes: Dashes are standardised as either short ( - ), medium ( – ) or long (
                    –––– ) and transcribed, according to normal usage, with a single space both
                    before and after the dash. Where obvious, we distinguish between straight and
                    ‘italicised/curly’ dashes. </li>
                <li>Brackets: Where obvious, we preserve any original distinction between square and
                    curved brackets, as well as the use of forward-slashes to serve as brackets. </li>
                <li>Postmarks, handstamps and franks: Postmarks and franks are provided at the foot
                    of the transcribed letters, alongside handstamps, given in the form of an ink
                    stamp near the handwritten address indicating the place of posting, e.g.
                    ‘HOLYWELL'. </li>
                <li>Superscript and subscript letters: These are preserved in the transcription. </li>
                <li>Full stops in abbreviations: These are standardised to some degree, to put the
                    full stop (if one exists) at the end of the abbreviated word – i.e. ‘W<sup>m</sup>.’ rather
                    than ‘W.<sup>m</sup>’ for ‘William’, regardless of the precise placement of the full stop
                    on the page. </li>
                <li>Long s (ſ): These are standardised as lower-case ‘s’. </li>
                <li>Salutations, colophons and signatures: Salutations (e.g. ‘Dear Sir’), colophons
                    (e.g. ‘I am Dear Sir’), and signatures maintain their place as in the original
                    documents. The original lineation has been preserved both when they appear
                    in-line with the following or preceding paragraph, and where they are separated
                    from the letter body in the manuscript. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Expansions and contractions</h3>
            <p> As David Fairer observes in his edition of Warton, ‘obsolete abbreviations are by
                far the largest obstacle to the readability of a text’. The naturalised
                transcriptions therefore expand or normalise all abbreviations not in standard use
                today: for example, ‘y<sup>e</sup>’ and ‘y<sup>t</sup>’ (where the ‘y’ is strictly speaking a thorn) are
                expanded to ‘the’ and ‘that’. Abbreviations that are self-explanatory, clear from
                the context in which they appear, or occur very frequently – e.g. ‘y<sup>r</sup>’ for ‘your’ –
                are retained.</p>
            <p> Some different rules apply for specific issues: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abbreviated signatures: These are relatively common, especially for first names
                    (i.e. ‘W<sup>m</sup>.’ and ‘J<sup>no</sup>.’ for ‘William’ and ‘John’). We do not expand these; the
                    person record for each person mentioned is linked to the document’s database
                    record, including the full version of their name. </li>
                <li>Contracted surnames: These – e.g. ‘Lady S.’, ‘Lord F.’, 'F.D.' – are not
                    expanded. Usages of this kind indicate informality and occasionally generate
                    ambiguity, and for both these reasons they are preserved. Where the person can
                    be identified, the name has been given an XML ID attribute and can be clicked by
                    the user to reveal biographical information. </li>
                <li>Contracted book titles: These – e.g ‘Br. Zool’ for <i>British Zoology</i> – have been
                    retained but tagged using an XML ID attribute that corresponds to the relevant
                    bibliographical record in the database. </li>
                <li>Common abbreviations: We do not expand any contraction which is still in common
                    and familiar use today (such as ‘Dr.’ for ‘Doctor’, for example). XML content
                    markup In addition to encoding each document’s structure (e.g. line and
                    paragraph breaks), a TEI P5 XML schema adapted to the aims of the project has
                    been used to mark up content features of each letter: place-names (both
                    contemporary and modern forms), people (referring to our biographical data
                    base), published works and their authors, and art works. These elements are
                    tagged using the &lt;placeName&gt;, &lt;persName&gt;, &lt;bibl&gt;, and
                    &lt;art&gt; tags respectively. The significant benefit of using XML in this way
                    is that we can apply the same numeric ID attribute to these elements regardless
                    of how a particular feature is spelled or expressed, especially useful given the
                    non-standardized nature of eighteenth-century toponyms, especially in Welsh or
                    Gaelic. Structural and orthographical elements are treated as follows: </li>
                <li>Letter header: Each document has a TEI header which includes a unique numerical
                    ID, an indicative title, the name of the original author and recipient, the date
                    and place of writing, the destination and the shelf-mark or bibliographical
                    details of the source letter. </li>
                <li>Textual divisions: Corresponding TEI tags are applied to the letter body,
                    salutation, closer, dateline, postscript and individual paragraphs. Elements
                    such as datelines are reproduced in the order that they appear in the original
                    letter, meaning that the structure of the XML documents varies slightly to
                    reflect the form of the source documents. </li>
                <li>Abbreviations and expansions: Where abbreviations in the original letter present
                    an obstacle to readablility, a normalised version is provided through the use of
                    XML encoding (e.g. &lt;choice&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;abbreviated
                    term&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;expan&gt;expanded term&lt;/expan&gt;&lt;/choice&gt;). </li>
                <li>Highlighted text and characters: Superscript, subscript, underlines and
                    italicised text are preserved in the transcription through the use of the
                    corresponding ‘&lt;hi rend=&lt;/hi&gt;’ XML encoding. </li>
                <li>Marginalia and annotations: Authorial footnotes and endnotes are retained but
                    standardised so that any authorial notes appear below the letter body and
                    postscript, with the point or span of attachment indicated through the ‘target’
                    attribute, and the location of the note in the source text through the ‘place’
                    attribute. Where possible, the symbol used to mark the note in the manuscript
                    has been reproduced or approximated, e.g. x. Marginal notes are placed at the
                    end of the paragraph to which they refer. Where the author of a note or
                    annotation differs from that of the main letter this is indicated through the
                    TEI &lt;resp&gt; (responsibility) element and the author identified if possible.
                    The &lt;handshift&gt; element is used to indicate the beginning of text written
                    in a new hand, whether in a note or elsewhere in the document. Both marginal
                    notes and authorial footnotes and endnotes are rendered distinctly from
                    editorial footnotes, the former attached to the text by Roman numerals, the
                    latter by Arabic numerals and appearing at the very end of the documents. </li>
                <li>Substitutions and additions: Authorial additions (where distinct from notes) and
                    substitutions of words and characters into a line or sequence are tagged in XML
                    and the position of the inserted text is given, e.g. above, below, margin. </li>
                <li>Deletions and illegible or unclear text: These are marked using XML elements.
                    Where legible, both strikethroughs and the words beneath them are reproduced; if
                    the deleted text is illegible but the number of deleted characters or words can
                    be determined, this quantity is provided. Gaps where text is illegible or
                    destroyed are indicated in the mark-up, with the number of missing characters or
                    words given where available. Text which has been transcribed but which is
                    unclear in the original document is also tagged accordingly. Reasons are given
                    for unclear or missing text, e.g. damaged or torn manuscripts. </li>
                <li>Lists and tables: These are common due to Pennant’s interest in natural history
                    and antiquarianism, and are reproduced as accurately as possible, inclusive of
                    lineation and alignment, with an approximate number of dotted lines or dashes
                    given to represent the original design where applicable – through priority has
                    been given to preserving the general layout of tables rather than reproducing
                    the precise quantity of characters used to form rows and borders. These features
                    are encoded as list or table elements in TEI XML.</li>
            </ul> Document information in the database record The record for each document, person,
            place, books or manuscript, and art work contains information in specific fields. These
            reflect categories used in the correspondence database Early Modern Letters Online
            (EMLO) and signal the compatibility of Curious Travellers editions with EMLO for
            purposes of further research across multiple fields of interest. <ul>
                <li>ID: This is the unique numerical identifier, assigned by the database. </li>
                <li>Date: There are three fields for each date (year, month and day). Where the date
                    of the letter is not clear from explicit dating on the document itself, or where
                    that dating is unclear due to damage or authorial error, there are three levels
                    of certainty: date inferred, date uncertain and date approximate. Our policy is
                    to use ‘inferred’ only if we can be certain, due to internal or surrounding
                    evidence, of a document’s date of writing, but there is no explicit dating on
                    the document itself. </li>
                <li>Languages: Languages used in the letter, e.g. English, Welsh, Latin </li>
                <li>Notes on Letter: Free-text notes on the letter – e.g if the manifestation is
                    unusual in some way, is evidently incomplete or if the letter originally
                    contained enclosures. </li>
                <li>Repository: Name of the institution in which the original document is held – e.g
                    National Library of Scotland </li>
                <li>Shelfmark: Shelfmark assigned to the original document by its repository. </li>
                <li>MS Manifestation: The form of the original document, e.g. manuscript letter,
                    draft, scribal copy. </li>
                <li>People connected to a document are linked to that document with a specific role,
                    which is always one of the following: <ul>
                        <li>Author – The person who has written, and typically signed, the letter.
                            Where there is ambiguity this field can be marked as Uncertain or
                            Inferred. </li>
                        <li>Recipient – The person to whom the letter is sent. Where there is
                            ambiguity this field can be marked as Uncertain or Inferred. </li>
                        <li>People Mentioned – Any people mentioned in the letter, who do not fit in
