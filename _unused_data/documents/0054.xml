                <p>Between the forming a Resolution &amp; the execution, Time generally places a few
                    circumstances as hints to review what perhaps was determined in passion, or
                    without sufficient Foresight. If a man fairly gets rid of these with honour,
                    &amp; feels a sense of Victory within, <del rend="overstrike">why</del> then is
                    his time if booted &amp; spurr'ed, to get upon his horse, &amp; make the best of
                    his way. Lest in the present case the contest might be doubtful, it appear'd the
                    best piece of generalship to get up early &amp; set off before we were quite
                    awake, that at breakfast yet 10 miles off, we might consider the matter coolly.
                    The consequence of which was as might be expected, there was no doubt stated
                    either of the propriety, or possibility, of executing our plan. Warm'd with
                    riding, &amp; cherished by a good breakfast, difficulties appeared <q>trifles
                        light as air,</q><note type="editorial">Shakespeare, <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I.iii.326.</note> &amp; to have return'd would have been
                    attended with more ignominy than we cared to meet with — therefore we were
                    forced to go on. –––––</p>
                <p>In passing to <placeName ref="pl0243">Queen's Ferry</placeName> to breakfast we
                    saw a girl of about the age of 16, standing with a poor elderly blind man by the
                    side of a brook — she had a little oatmeal in one hand &amp; was putting some
                    water to it with the other, she then mixed it up a little, &amp; fed him with it
                    — as we check our Horses a little we saw her give him several pieces before we
                    had got past her, &amp; as it was pity she should ever want <pb n="f.1v"/><fw>2</fw>meal, we gave here a trifling donation — this was probably his
                    Daughter, &amp; surely engaged inob an office at which Humanity must feel a glow
                    of approbation — it was however too soon as yet to meet with adventures, &amp;
                    after thinking that the Dutch were perfectly justifiable in making it death for
                    every person who killed a Stork,<note type="editorial">A reference to the belief
                        that storks cared for their parents in old age.</note> we rode briskly on —
                    There is as yet Virtue in the world, says <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> — After breakfast we had to cross a Ferry full two miles
                    wide over <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName> — as it is much passed
                    we had our wherry quite full of Carts, &amp; Horses, &amp; bullocks, &amp;
                    people — in going over we passed by a little Island about <del rend="overstrike">in</del> the middle, on which are the ruins of an old castle called
                        <placeName ref="pl0370">Garvey</placeName> — now the habitation of Sea Gulls
                    — it appears to have <add place="above">been</add> pretty extensive, &amp; with
                    Cannon would command <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName> — After
                    landing we were called into a house by a woman who knew something of <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> to give our advice upon a sick Child — this
                    we did most readily, &amp; you will believe me when I tell you to the best of
                    our Abilities — We were happy in having this early opportunity of doing good —
                    we certainly meant it as part of our embassy —</p>
                <p>We now enter <placeName ref="pl1190">Fife shire</placeName>, &amp; ascending some
                    of the Hills up a good road command an extensive view of <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName> below, with several little Fishing towns upon its
                    Skirts — the <placeName ref="pl1189">Castle of Dumferline</placeName> is within
                    our view. I believe I should have done more justice in calling it a monastery,
                    but it is so ruined now that you may call it almost what you please —<note type="editorial">Pattisson may be conflating Dunfermline Palace with the
                        Cathedral.</note>
                    <persName ref="pe0606">Sir James Preston</persName> has a pleasing modern <pb n="f.2r"/>
                    <fw>3</fw> built house about half a mile from the road — the grounds are totally
                    laid out, but the wood seems mostly natural — we pass thro <placeName ref="pl0374">Culross</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="pl1191">Torryburn</placeName> two neat little Towns &amp; arrive at <placeName ref="pl1192">Kincardine</placeName> to dinner — we were here not likely to
                    get any meat unless we would eat some part of Sheep which we then saw fleaing —
                    we had it stew'd &amp; made a tolerable dinner — as some time elapsed before it
                    could decently be got ready, we took a walk into that resort of the living &amp;
                    the dead the Churchyard, not without thinking as we cast our eyes upon some
                    painted Tomb stones, 'that a living Dog is better than a dead Lion.'<note type="editorial">Ecclesiastes 9:4.</note> As stones are easily procured in
                        <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> almost every grave has one,
                    &amp; as the Idea of being remember'd is not so transient as the thing itself,
                    people in general, we found, had only put the initials of their names upon the
                    Stones, with this line in passant upon every one of them "Memento more." Why can
                    we not as well be serious in english at once, &amp; speak out "Remember
                    Death"?</p>
                <p>Our ride after dinner was very pleasing — altho the morning had been foggy, the
                    Sun now bore some power, &amp; altho the clouds quitted the Hills with
                    reluctance, yet they were forced to it — as we could look down upon <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName>, we could plainly discern several small
                    clouds resting upon it — dissipating by degrees — we arrived about 7 at
                        <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName> to which we had been guided for
                    some miles by a view of <placeName ref="pl1193">the castle</placeName> — as soon
                    as we had put up our horses, we rushed up to <placeName ref="pl1193">the
                        castle</placeName> to take a view of the Country below —</p>
                <p><pb n="f.2v"/>
                    <fw>4</fw> The sun was just peeping over Moncrief Hills<note type="editorial">Pattisson is probably confusing Moncreiffe Hill near Perth with the
                        Campsies south West of Stirling; the former would not be visible from
                        Stirling Castle.</note> &amp; the evening was tolerably clear — we had a
                    noble view of the windings of the <placeName ref="pl1116">the
                        Firth</placeName>,<note type="editorial">Here and later in the journal,
                        Pattisson continues to refer to the River Forth as the Firth.</note> which
                    within 4 miles of <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName> is said to run a
                    circling course of 20 miles — the country on both sides is rich, &amp; upon some
                    slight eminences in this delightful Vale you see the remains of two old abbies,
                    &amp; a castle; the first nearly obscured by trees — the monks always seemd to
                    know which point of the Country was most fruitful, &amp; at a time when there
                    were devils, &amp; witches, it was necessary those who had to combat them should
                    be well supplied — you may here see the towns on both coasts, &amp; it is said
                    on a clear day you may see <placeName ref="pl1031">Edinburgh Castle</placeName>
                    35 miles distance, which from the situation I should suppose very possible — As
                    we return from the Castle we view the remains of an old royal palace the lurking
                    place of the old Scotch Kings — it was a place of some strength, &amp; such
                    places were often necessary when a kingdom so weakly <unclear reason="illegible">connected</unclear> as was <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName>,
                    was in trouble — <sic>over the gateway without side</sic> are placed figures of

                    in that part very narrow —</p>
                <p>As I stood over the Door of the Stable, I had the pleasure of being taken by one
                    of the Fraternity for a <placeName ref="pl0489">Manchester</placeName> rider —
                    as it was pity a man should be disappointed who had made so serious an attack, I
                    held a discourse with him for a few minutes upon the loss of trade, &amp; of the
                    little I knew of their manufactures — whether I gave him any satisfaction, or
                    no, I do not know, but he seem'd very well contented — he was a perfect <hi rend="underline">Flat</hi> &amp; a person must be strangely out to make
                    discord with him. —</p>
                <p>I saw a great number of Girls at <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>
                    exceedingly beautiful, which I think is in great measure to be attributed to the
                    manner of their wearing their hair — it is long &amp; combed back before, &amp;

                <p>We set out from <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName> very early in the

                    — it is next to impossible for an englishman to be understood; we however were
                    fortunately rectified by a man &amp; forced to go past the very house we had set
                    off from — it was in vain to be angry, altho we were much disposed to it — Where
                    every person thinks himself a land surveyor, &amp; a calculator of Distances, no
                    wonder we should meet with different accounts — from <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName> to <placeName ref="pl1194">Baglivy</placeName> altho
                    we asked almost every person we met, we did not receive two accounts alike —
                    some called it by the scotch mile which is 1½ english — some by the english —
                    but more by their own computation — a person need only be tired when he measures
                    a distance, &amp; he scarce <add place="above">k</add>nows where to set bounds
                    to it — habit afterwards, &amp; the persecution of his neighbours for his
                    mistaken notion, render it sacred to him —</p>
                <p>The Scotch are said to be very inquisitive after news — a little Farmer on a
                    hobby attacked <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> who was jogging on
                    before, by asking him what news — how the crops were southward, &amp; whether
                    many cattle were gone to <placeName ref="pl0948">Haddington</placeName> Fair — I
                    do not know what answers <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> gave him, but
                    the man rode whistling contentedly past me — After riding six or seven miles
                    most of which was rather ascending, we came within view of <placeName ref="pl0609">Ben Lomond</placeName> to the right of us — this is supposed
                    the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

                    a thick horizon of distant clouds — there is an amazing long chain of mountains
                    connected with him, &amp; as some of them are high they take off from his real
                    height, altho they are by no means equal to him — we <del rend="overstrike">now</del> passed thro a country altho not very rich well cultivated &amp; I
                    am informed that Labourers in the fields receive from 6 to 8 a day — as we were
                    now upon a very high ground we saw some clouds hanging by the side of a hill
                    above us &amp; floating within <add place="above">an</add> 100 yards of us — as
                    the sun shone upon them their shade varied &amp; now &amp; then we received a
                    few drops from them —</p>
                <p>The Farm houses around have a very good appearance — they have each a few trees
                    around them &amp; the lands are not divided by walls, or hedges, so that if any
                    person puts our a horse, or Cow, to feed he fastens it by a long line to some
                    spot — sufficient space is allowed to graze &amp; no inconvenience ensues — it
                    is not uncommon to see Horses, Cows, Hogs, &amp; sheep thus all tied up together
                    — &amp; as it is in general not approved by all, the mixture of voices makes the
                    purest discord.</p>
                <p>At <placeName ref="pl1194">Baglivy</placeName> where we breakfasted there is a
                    little manufactory of Linnen carried on — generally of Coarse Cloths which are
                    wove for little more than 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> a yard — 'tho the price
                    differs as it is more or less fine — you will smile, when I tell you, that I
                    observed here a particular species of Hens, with very short Legs, &amp; which
                    wadled like Ducks — they had not feathers upon their <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible">wings</unclear></del> legs, but were in
                    every respect <pb n="f.4v"/><fw>8</fw> like other fowls — I could get not
                    information concerning them, or as you are guardian of a little dutch colony
                    would have informed you —</p>
                <p>We had a long &amp; a very hot ride to the <placeName ref="pl1195">Ford o'
                        Balloch</placeName> to Dinner — in our way we saw at a distance <placeName ref="pl0610">a large modern house</placeName> belonging to <persName ref="pe0174">the Duke of Montrose</persName> — it seems placed on the south
                    side of those high mountains I have mentioned &amp; a noble serpentine River
                    rolls before <add place="above">it</add> — it commands a good view of the
                    Country — not far from the road we see the Remains of <placeName ref="pl1197">Kilmaranock Castle</placeName>, nearly obscured by trees. It is impossible
                    to look upon these reliques of greatness, without figuring to ourselves the
                    state of those persons who once inhabited them, when in their glory — Sovereigns
                    of the plains below, &amp; not allowing or not having any equal but <add place="above">at</add> a distance, they ruled their vassals with an iron
                    hand. Fosterd in pride by a perpetual view of their own greatness, &amp; taught
                    a spirit of Cruelty by their enemies, they could set no bounds to their
                    passions. It was fortunate for the peace of <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName>, when the King could gain so much power as to check
                    &amp; control these petty disturbers of mankind. –––––</p>
                <p>As we approach the Ford the Country becomes more bold, &amp; mountainous, &amp;
                    in consequence more barren. The crops are thin &amp; few &amp; intirely oats —
                    There is however a considerable quantity of Lint grown hereabouts — the Country
                    suits it, &amp; it is convenient for the large Linnen manufactory at <placeName ref="pl0605">paisley</placeName>. — They have very little notion of the
                    advantages of a wheel carriage in this part of the Country — instead of which
                    they use large baskets fastened upon two sticks — the short ends of which serve
                    as wheels, &amp; drag on the ground — the long as shafts — they cut a droll
                    appearance &amp; we mett with vast numbers of them mostly driven by women, <pb n="f.5r"/><fw>9</fw>who in this country carry the whip — as a badge of
                    Slavery. It is true we mett with a few with wheels, but they were exceedingly
                    awkward, and generally made of the slice of a large Tree cut horizontally, &amp;
                    a whole cut in the middle for the axle — They were solid or nearly so &amp; it
                    is probable not unlike what the Grecian Heroes used to manage with so much
                    dexterity — I wished for <persName ref="pe0620">Antilochus</persName> to inform
                    me. —</p>
                <p>We had a most wretched Dinner at <placeName ref="pl1195">the Ford,</placeName>,
                    Oatmeal, Bannocks, &amp; Salmon that <hi rend="underline">very</hi> far from
                    being sweet — but as we expected this we did not regard it — our philosophy came
                    in to our aid &amp; whisper'd to us, that few were the necessaries of Life —
                    &amp; that what we had seen every where else was in reality — the Luxuries.</p>
                <p>––––– After dinner we pass the <placeName ref="pl1063">River Leven</placeName> in
                    a boat — it is narrow but so deep that it is not prudent to attempt it without —
                    We soon got into the great Road that leads North from <placeName ref="pl0229">Glasgow</placeName>, &amp; which is exceedingly good — it was lined by
                    trees, which as the sun shone made it shady, &amp; agreable — We rode up by the
                    Side of <placeName ref="pl0223">Loch Lomond</placeName>, the largest &amp; most
                    beautiful Lake in <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> — it is no less
                    than 24 miles in length, &amp; in some parts 8 miles over. — it is fresh water,
                    &amp; there are a great number of Islands in it, many of which are coverd with
                    wood. The largest is called <placeName ref="pl1205">Inch Murray</placeName>,
                    &amp; belongs to the <persName ref="pe0174">Duke of Montrose</persName> — there
                    are several Houses on it &amp; it is well stocked with Deer — on the further
                    side of the Lake, &amp; stretching to the north are a ridge of very high
                    mountains of which <placeName ref="pl0609">Ben Lomond</placeName> is the Tyrant
                    — to the high left the ground is high &amp; barren — As you ride along the scene
                    is perpetually altering, new Islands appear or you see the old ones in different
                    points of view — Within about 4 miles of <placeName ref="pl0224">Luss</placeName>, upon a promontory projecting into the Loch, is a<pb n="f.5v"/><fw>10</fw>

                <p>Evening now came on apace. &amp; the last Rays of the Sun blended with the pure

                <p>In inquiring after the price of Labour here I am informed that it is from 10<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> to 12<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> a Day — &amp;
                    the cause assign'd is that there are so few people, &amp; those mostly employd
                    to procure subsistence to themselves — for where money can not easily be spent,
                    it is not of much worth — The Road which we now take to the west is exceedingly
                    mountainous; but still as we cast our eyes back <placeName ref="pl0609">Ben
                        Lomond</placeName> seems to follow us, &amp; it is a long time before we
                    intirely lose sight of him — after <del rend="overstrike">about</del> 6 miles
                    slow riding we arrive in a vale called <placeName ref="pl1068">Glencrow</placeName>, — about a mile &amp;½ long <pb n="f.8r"/><fw>15</fw>
                    &amp; one would suppose nearly that depth from the Top of the surrounding hills
                    — there is a river running along the bottom of it, &amp; a good road thro it —
                    as you enter it there is a little twist of the Road, &amp; when you arrive at
                    about the middle you seem shut out from all nature — the heights &amp; nakedness
                    of the rocks around, the noise of some waterfalls precipitating down, now small
                    from the great Drought we have had, renders <placeName ref="pl1068">Glencrow</placeName> the most awful &amp; sublime place I ever enterd. I
                    can however conceive it still more so, when in winter the Torrents are roaring
                    down its sides — or in declining autumn the Tempest vents his rage on the
                    surrounding Hills — here the Fates might hold a secure retreat while they spin,
                    or cut the thread of mortal beings –––––</p>
                <p>In going out of this Vale you pass a very steep hill — the road was cut by the
                    military at an immense trouble — about the middle a stone is erected with this
                    inscription <placeName ref="pl0220">"Rest &amp; be thankful."</placeName> which
                    we accordingly did, as we were obliged to lead out Horses up. We pass along

                    I suppose they could make as good a shift now — indeed it was sometime before
                    they would cultivate them at all — 'their Fathers lived without &amp; why could
                    not they' — this was by no means conclusive, &amp; every house now has a small
                    piece of potatoe land — they have become exceedingly fond of them — The little
                    hay which they have grows among their houses — this they cut &amp; toss about
                    &amp; afterwards lay up for winter, but from what we saw there was not

                    <fw>16</fw> We pass by several reliques of old houses. the inhabitants when
                    tired of one place remove with great facility to another — it is only carrying
                    the wood of the roof along with them, &amp; placing a few stones in a half
                    regular order, again placing on the wood &amp; covering it with Turf, &amp; the
                    house is made — they sometimes remove this for the sake of feeding their cattle
                    in the Summer — sometimes for better neighbourhood — they have no chimnies in
                    their houses but the smoke escapes from the middle of the house which way it can
                    — they rarely have any floor, but the earth, — or beds, <unclear reason="illegible">them</unclear> dry'd braken or hether. as they talk
                    nothing but Erse, we could only discourse with them by signs — We met several

                        <placeName ref="pl1139">the Lowlands</placeName> for harvest, &amp; it is

                    —</p>
                <p>I met with a drover going with a great number of Lambs to market — the price of

                    many of them off as they can before winter — they can at present only keep a set
                    quantity, 'till a greater spirit of improvement has taught them to plant turnips
                    for their cattle, as well as potatoes for themselves.</p>
                <p>Just as we came to <placeName ref="pl1069">Cairndow</placeName> we passed the

                    the Loch reaches nearly up to his house, &amp; as vessels come up it, forms a

                        <placeName ref="pl1249">Bornaro</placeName> — as our road did not lay past
                    it, I can give no particular account of it — It is carried on by some English
                    gentlemen in <placeName ref="pl1044">Lancashire</placeName> at a considerable
                    expence — the Scotch are not so much inclined to tempt Fortune — &amp; I am
                    informed the reason why they carry it on at this distance, is the readiness with
                    which they procure charcoal — &amp; perhaps the cheapness of the Labour — it is
                    said that a good part of the Iron stone is bought from <placeName ref="pl1044">Lancashire</placeName> — There is constantly 200 men employed &amp; as many
                    of them are from <placeName ref="pl1044">Lancashire</placeName>, it is quite an

                <p>It now began to be time to make some Inquiry concerning <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName>, &amp; as the man seemed sufficiently gnostic I could not
                    omit the opportunity — he said he had frequently heard the songs sung in the
                    Galic, which <persName ref="pe0558">M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>pherson</persName> had translated — but by no means so regular as

                    made them — People who could neither read, or write, got them by heart, &amp;
                    many could say several hundred — the <pb n="f.12v"/><fw>21</fw> man said
                    thousand <del rend="overstrike">of</del> Lines. he said they were translated
                    with great difficulty, on account of the conciseness of the Erse language. —
                    upon the whole he did not speak well of <persName ref="pe0558">M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>pherson</persName>, &amp; the poems as for him
                    might as well be any body's else as <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian's</persName>.
                    ––––– From <placeName ref="pl1248">Killechrannan</placeName> we passed for 12
                    miles over the most uncultivated, &amp; horrid Country, that ever was crossed by
                    man — we neither saw a house nor met a person during the whole way — we passed
                    indeed two or three little huts, erected by the herdsmen to shelter themselves
                    in the evening — one of which we had the curiosity to go into; it is made
                    intirely of earth &amp; is something in form of a centinel's box. we had to pass
                    up, &amp; down, mountains <sic>all the way a foot pace</sic> — thro difficult,
                    &amp; sometimes dangerous tracks, &amp; what added to our feelings was that we
                    did not know whether we had not got into a wrong one — we could only steer due
                    West as we <del rend="overstrike">had got</del><add place="above">carried</add>
                    a Book or two in our pockets, when we had got about half-way we say on the
                    ground, &amp; amused ourselves for half an hour — without Fear of being
                    disturbed, &amp; as every object inspir'd Veneration, &amp; taught us
                    dependance, it was not half an hour spent in vain — it was only permitting the
                    objects to have their proper effect upon you, &amp; you became at once serious,
                    &amp; <unclear reason="illegible">thoughtful</unclear> at length we came into a
                    rich &amp; pleasing vale which was watered by a Loch, &amp; seem'd the
                    habitation of some happier race — it is called the <placeName ref="pl2731">Vale

                        directly to Oban from Bonawe, he and Lister seem to detour slightly to the
                        south via the small settlement of Kilmore. That Pattisson deviates from the
                        main route to Oban probably explains the poor quality of the roads he
                        encounters here, and which he returns to comment upon later in the
                        journal.</note> altho' rather tired we had been well entertained by the
                    novelty, and grandeur, of the objects we had seen, &amp; I am sure we felt

                    <fw>22</fw> It was rather late in the Afternoon when we arrived at <placeName ref="pl3216">Kilmoor</placeName>. It was the day for the administration of
                    the Sacrament, which in these parts is only done once a year, &amp; the country
                    for a great number of miles around had sent its inhabitants in all their best
                    attire — it seem'd a general day of rejoicing — &amp; men were kissing one
                    another with all due affection, who, I suppose, had not seen one another for at
                    least a year before — This was rather a new scene, &amp; had it not been for the
                    extreme ignorance of the people in every other respect, we should perhaps have
                    looked upon it with purer affections — As the minister had not finished we went
                    in, &amp; heard a Sermon in English by a <persName ref="pe2235">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persName>. Translator of several Galic
                    poems, &amp; which I suppose from the peculiarity of the expression was a mere
                    galic translation too. It is customary to preach one part of the day in english,
                    the other galic, &amp; as <sic>goverment</sic> has fixed English Schools through
                    the highlands, there are many who can understand both — I suppose there were not
                    less at that time than 400 people, all in the highland dress, &amp; many who
                    could not understand English were gone home — after service was ended, we were
                    entreated to dine at a good ordinary, at a neighboring House — which we had no
                    objection too — two or three of the Elders were there, &amp; we had a very
                    orderly, &amp; civil dinner — people are by no means enthusiastically religious
                    hereabouts, they have sufficient to point out their Duty, but little to kindle
                    up their affections — in consequence of which you see little impropriety of
                    behaviour among them &amp; dishonest practices are altogether unheard of — the
                    oldest among th<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> can scarce remember anything like a

                    <fw>23</fw> We had now an easy ride of about four miles to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>, which we took in the evening in the middle of
                    several of our new friends. I have the food fortune to ride <del rend="overstrike">along</del> with a sensible old fellow whose belief &amp;
                    opinion of the works of <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName> were only
                    equalld by the simplicity, &amp; Candour with which he spoke of them — he
                    allowed there were no writings in Galic above 200 years old, &amp; modestly
                    supposed that they came the other 1100 years thro the pure channel of Tradition
                    — the word God in Erse is evidently derived from the roman, Deus — it is called
                    Deusch — how spelt I do not know –––––</p>
                <p>As we ascended the hills in our way to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>
                    we had a noble view of the <placeName ref="pl2195">Sound of Mull</placeName> —
                    there were, at that time, no ships passing thro it — it was evening, &amp; we

                <p>As we had a letter to <persName ref="pe1685">Macdougal</persName>, the Laird of
                    that family, which we thought we could not well present before eleven or 12
                    oClock we took a little walk with a person of great civility about <placeName ref="pl1076">oban</placeName>. We were now come into the Land where we
                    expected to collect something about the <hi rend="underline">second</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">sight</hi>, of which we had heard, &amp; expected so much.
                    —</p>
                <p>All that we could learn upon inquiry was, that it was still believed by many,
                    &amp; that a story <add place="above">of an affair</add> which had happened in
                    the late Rebellion, had now gained universal Credit. The Servant of a Captain
                    then employed against the Rebels, begg'd of his Master not to go to the
                    engagement at <placeName ref="pl0155">Culloden</placeName>, for he feared he
                    would be killed — the gentleman as Captain persisted — it must be mere Fancy,
                    &amp; what had Soldiers to do with Fancy. The man in vindication of himself
                    acquainted his Friends that he had seen the appearance of his master, a few days
                    before, slain, &amp; the blood running down from his Forehead — the Captain
                    however would not be intimidated, &amp; fell at <placeName ref="pl0155">Culloden</placeName>, by a ball entering the place precisely as the Servant
                    foretold — There are a number of similar stories, which I suppose, have equal
                    claim to our Credulity. In <placeName ref="pl2473">the western
                        Islands</placeName> it is said to be much more believed, &amp; indeed it is
                    credited in proportion to the distance, or obscurity of the place, &amp; the
                    consequent ignorance of the people. –––––</p>
                <p>A little to the right of <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName> upon a steep
                    projecting eminence, a few years ago an urn was dug up. It was about eight Feet
                    under ground, &amp; contained in a large stone box, of which the Lid now graces
                    a Blacksmiths <pb n="f.14v"/><fw>25</fw> Forge. Within the urn were found a
                    brown earth, some small pieces of Bone, &amp; some ashes — the urn was made of
                    dry'd Clay, &amp; some sculptur'd Figures yet remained upon it. It was carried
                    to a neighboring gentleman's house intire but the wife insisted upon the
                    immediate burial of it — it was sacrilege — it was accordingly replaced, broke
                    &amp; buried — There are several appearances near which would justify a search,
                    &amp; we wished sincerely for spades, &amp; permission to begin. — They are
                    called <hi rend="underline">Cairns</hi> &amp; are composed of either one piece
                    of Rock, or several laid together, &amp; we are informed that it was the custom
                    with the old highlanders, as they passed by one of these, always to lay a stone
                    to the heap already collected. In some parts this custom is still continued,
                    where any murder hath been committed, or any thing remarkable occurred.</p>
                <p>Upon this eminence in days of Yore we are likewise informed, that a court of
                    Justice was held by some of the old Scotch Kings, for the tryal of various
                    offences; &amp; there is still part of a stone projecting from the side of this
                    rock on which, Justice immediately suspended the culprit by a twist of heath, if
                    he was found guilty —</p>
                <p>— In our return to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName> we passed thro a good
                    piece of Oats — the height of several of the Stems were 5 Feet, &amp; they had
                    between 80 &amp; 100 grains upon each — this was certainly very different from
                    any thing that we had before seen —</p>
                <p>I again make inquiry concerning <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName>, &amp;
                    am again told that there are several people that can speak long passages with
                    facility — his name is well known, but we can learn nothing for certain —</p>
                <p>The Spirit of the feudal System, which so frequently deluged <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> in blood, is now disappearing daily.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.15r"/>
                    <fw>26</fw> The several severe acts of Parlaiment, the luxury &amp; inattention
                    of the lairds, &amp; the increasing commerce of many of the little Towns near
                    the Sea, have much contributed to destroy the spirit of Clanships. There are
                    many Salt water Lochs which run up into the heart of the Country, &amp; which
                    render communication easy; &amp; the poorer people paying rent instead of
                    service for their Lands, will by degrees tend effectually to break the trammels
                    of Dependency &amp; Slavery. Still however the Campbells, the Fraziers, &amp;c
                    are capable of doing a great deal by their names, &amp; connexions — &amp; I
                    should think it a proper Question how far it would be consistent with national
                    policy to break the present ties — as by this means the best troops can be
                    raised with the utmost facility — on the other hand it favours rebellion &amp;
                    ––––– but we are not to prescribe to the nation, without hope of Fee or
                    Reward</p>
                <p>The use of the Dirks or daggers are now nearly laid aside — it was not long since
                    every Labourer wore it by the side of his sickle, &amp;, that even hospitality
                    must have endured to see it lye by the side of the Feast. It is said that a few
                    years ago an english gentleman dining in company at a Lairds, observed this
                    custom, &amp; every man coolly pulling out his Dagger, with astonishment. he
                    immediately withdrew, &amp; as he had a pair of Horse pistols upon his Saddle,
                    brought them in, &amp; laid them down on each side of him with equal Composure —
                    &amp; I should think had a much better appetite for his Dinner. ––––– They used
                    likewise to go to the Kirk completely accoutre'd, &amp; he whose arms were the
                    most bright or numerous was the most genteel — the others, it is presumed,
                    supplied the dire deficiency by Looks — this was surely taking Heaven by
                    Violence. –––––</p>

                    we hastned down to present him with the Letter which <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> had for him. He received us with much ease, &amp;
                    Civility, &amp; engaged to afford us every assistance — He made several
                    apologies for his appearance, which I am sure If he knew how well it became him,
                    he would certainly not have done — it was a frock well worn yet neat &amp;
                    clean, his stockings &amp; shoes were what every Farmer should wear — we should
                    not however have observed these, if he had not pointed them out himself — we

                    given to the <persName ref="pe2220">Duke of Argyle</persName>, who, not many
                    years ago return'd them to the present Laird — it was a deed worthy of him,

                    him speak of the Argyle Family, feels the obligation with the gratitude of a

                    his behaviour liberal — there is however a kind of harshness which people

                        Dunstaffage</placeName>, formerly a royal residence — it is about 3 miles
                    distant, &amp; an agreable ride. The Castle is placed upon a rock, near a Loch,
                    which as it stands high it seems to command. the outward walls yet remain pretty
                    intire, &amp; it was during the last rebellion the Line of Conveyance from
                        <placeName ref="pl0229">Glasgow</placeName>, to <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort
                        William</placeName> — It has a drawbridge which was made use of in 1745. A
                    great number of fine old Trees are placed near it, &amp; the walls are coverd
                    with Ivy. When we came near the castle we saw <persName ref="pe2000">the
                        Laird</persName> in the midst of his haymakers — he step'd forward, &amp;
                    greeted us. He then took us to an <placeName ref="pl3194">old
                        Chappel</placeName> now in ruins, but near which from the situation of a
                    neighboring rock, there is a remarkable Echo — so that if a Dog is called on one
                    side of the Chapple he immediately runs to the other. it has not been long
                    discover'd, but is well worth hearing. The Laird still continues to bury in one
                    end of the Chappel. He insisted upon our accompanying him to the Castle, which
                    we ascend by a number of steps, &amp; <del rend="overstrike">we</del> enter it
                    thro an immense thick wall —this entry is well defended by a Strong gate, &amp;
                    draw bridge — &amp; it is accessible on no other side — He has built himself a
                    good modern house with the Castle. He informed us that there had been a well dug
                    in the top of the Rock 35 Fathom deep, &amp; which he had filled up — I presume
                    they were short Fathom.</p>

                    <fw>29</fw> From the top of the walls we had a noble view, a little obscured by
                    evening, of <placeName ref="pl2195">the sound of mull</placeName> to the west —
                    to the north, cross the Loch, <placeName ref="pl2194">Beregonium</placeName> the

                    drank a bottle of wine with him. He seems much interested for <persName ref="pe0558">Macpherson</persName>, &amp; says that he procured him some of
                        <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian's</persName> poems, which M<hi rend="superscript">c.</hi>pherson has not <hi rend="underline">done justice
                        to</hi>; what he meant by this I do not know. He says that when he was a
                    child, he recollects to have heard in Erse long, &amp; connected Tales, for 6 or
                    7 Hours together — he confesses that they cannot have been written long — but
                    thinks the race of the bards, quite sufficient, to have transmitted them pure.
                    upon the whole I was not better satisfied with his account, that the rest that I
                    met with — We took leave of him about 10 &amp; returnd peacably to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>.</p>

                    think we might have expected more; but what can a man do who wants evidence —
                    &amp; to support the dignity of 1700 years requires some plausible evidence, or
                    reasoning at least — but perhaps it is not to be met with —</p>
                <p>Every proprietor of an estate is now called a Laird — &amp; a man who merely

                    little is met with — where Education does not interfere, characters arise as

                    Ignorance that men are induced to practise the one, or remain contented in the
                    other — Every Laird that we met with seemd to possess a spirit of Intolerance,
                    or rather a warm sense of Independence — used to controul the vassals on their
                    estates, &amp; to command the services of others without fear of Denial, they
                    enter the Hall with a roughness, &amp; Freedom that excites admiration, &amp;
                    commands respect. The civility of many proceded from a generous disposition,
                    &amp; a real warmth of Soul — in others we thought we perceived a constraint,
                    &amp; it is not improbable that with many that hospitality which was once
                    supported as a virtue, is now as a habit; &amp; that in a few years the

                    about a mile from <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>. In our way thither
                    we pass'd by a very singular Rock, standing near the Sea, &amp; seperated not
                    less than 12 yards from the neighboring Cliff. It is about 30 Feet high, &amp;
                    20 round, &amp; in form somewhat resembles a nine pin, standing on its wrong
                    end. It is covered over with a long white moss, &amp; at a little distance has a
                    venerable appearance. It consists of what is called plumbpudding stone, of which
                    likewise the rocks near this coast for several mile are form'd. The <persName ref="pe2221">Bishop of Derry</persName> who a few years ago visited these
                    parts, supposes, &amp; with some degree of probability, that this kind of stone
                    must be owing to some former Volcanoes — but at what date he had not the modesty
                    to hint. As Tradition however affords no supports to this conjecture, &amp; to
                    interfere with the present Chronology would be a presuming, &amp; a silly
                    attempt, you will excuse my saying any more about it — I shall not indeed excuse
                    you from conjecturing how stones in every respect like those which lay near the
                    Sea, of every size, &amp; hardness, should have been fixed in a dark kind of
                    Cement resembling Lava petrified, &amp; piled up to immense heights. —</p>
                <p>As we approach the Castle we pass thro some exceeding good pasturage, where there
                    is a great deal of natural Clover, &amp; ascending this a flourishing avenue of
                    Trees, arrive at the house which the present Laird has built at some small
                    distance from the Castle — as it is defended by the hill on which the Castle
                    stands on one side, &amp; trees on the other, it is secure from the violent
                    winds which are otherwise here much to be dreaded. The Castle itself was
                    originally <pb n="f.18r"/><fw>32</fw> built without mortar, &amp; it is now in a
                    very ruinous state. About 30 years ago, during a thunder storm, a great piece of

                    &amp; a woman occasionally, yet from the resistance of the Tide we were 5 Hours
                    going over. It was only 9 miles &amp; the Sea was tolerably Smooth. Where we
                    landed it was rocky, &amp; we had a disagreable ride on <placeName ref="pl0729">Mull</placeName> for about 2 miles to <placeName ref="pl3195">Auchnacraig</placeName>, where we dined on Eggs, &amp; procured a guide

                <p>As we are now opposite the ecchoing Hills of <placeName ref="pl0683">Morven</placeName>, we are again tempted to inquire concerning the poems of
                        <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName>, &amp; altho they are believed here
                    with a degree of tenacity, which only Ignorance could produce, yet, I do assure
                    you we could gain no intelligence at all worth communicating. It is true a
                    gentleman of our acquaintance had lately been traversing the country, &amp;
                    collecting such scraps as fell in his way, &amp; we were entertained with a
                    translation of two or three of them; but, what with fiddles, &amp; Cupids, the
                    spirit of <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName> had so evaporated, that as
                    dregs of the last Century they could only become fit subjects of Ridicule. I
                    fortunately <pb n="f.19v"/><fw>35</fw> had a close imitation of <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName> in my pocket, which I pulled out, &amp; read,
                    feigning that it had originated in <placeName ref="pl0711">the
                        highlands</placeName>, &amp; begging to know whether they had ever heard any
                    thing similar — 'yes' — &amp; the gentleman, whose curiosity they much
                    applauded, had picked up the very same — they recollected it well' — this was
                    certainly want of Recollection, or from a worse motive, for it was not easy to
                    conceive how that which was written at <placeName ref="pl3199">Colchester</placeName>, could have come from the mouth of a highland bard,
                    or pass thro the maze of 1300 years — this may serve as a specimen how little we
                    could rely upon the account of those people, whose interest led them to support
                        <persName ref="pe0557">Ossian</persName>, &amp; whose honesty was no bar to
                    the use of improper weapons. –––––</p>
                <p>They have still a great number of red Deer upon the mountains, or in the woods of
                        <placeName ref="pl0729">Mull</placeName> — they are exceedingly shy, &amp;
                    altho they have dogs of great strength &amp; speed, yet they rarely catch any of
                    them — they sometimes lay in wait for them as they come down to feed upon the
                    young potatoes, of which they are very fond, &amp; shoot them. A Fawn was killed
                    in this manner the morning we were there. We saw here a remarkable strong, &amp;
                    swift breed of Dogs, of which we are informed there are but very few now in the
                    country — it seems of the greyhound breed, but much stronger. They still
                    continue to name the Dogs after <persName ref="pe0557">Ossians</persName>
                    manner, as <persName ref="pe2227">Branno</persName>, <persName ref="pe2226">Ryno</persName>, &amp;c &amp; with great familiarity have given the names
                    of <persName ref="pe0557">Ossians</persName> heroes to some of them, as
                        <persName ref="pe1638">Oscar</persName> &amp; <persName ref="pe2228">Toscar</persName>. –––––</p>
                <p>In our way to <placeName ref="pl1091">Scarlasdale</placeName>, I observed our
                    guide to stoop, &amp; picking up a stone, throw it upon a heap which he passed
                    by — this heap I found upon inquiry to be a cairn, but, whether it was placed
                    there in memorial of some murder — or that some Laird was <pb n="f.20r"/><fw>36</fw> buried there, or for something more worthy of it, neither our
                    guide, nor any body else whom we asked, could inform us. We could do no less
                    than get off our horses, &amp; add our mark of respect to what might be the Tomb
                    of a departed Hero.</p>
                <p>— The coast of <placeName ref="pl0683">Morven</placeName> nearly opposite
                        <placeName ref="pl1091">Scarlasdale</placeName> is rather flat, &amp; we
                    could plainly discover a few houses, trees &amp; Oxen. <placeName ref="pl0729">The Island of Mull</placeName> is in many places well stocked with Trees,
                    mostly of the birch kind — There is very little Corn grown, scarcely sufficient
                    for the people, &amp; we could not get a grain for our Horses, all the time we
                    were in <placeName ref="pl0729">Mull</placeName>. The Land well suits with
                    grazing — We at one time purposed to have left our horses at <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>, &amp; to have purchased or hired two horses
                    of the Country to have gone over <placeName ref="pl1076">Mull</placeName> with;
                    but as it was probable these would not be easily procured, &amp; the expence
                    would certainly be greater, we made our own horses do very well — These horses
                    are small &amp; are called Sheltees: &amp; are said to have some of the Spanish
                    breed in them, from a few which escaped the wreck of one of the Ships of the
                    Spanish Armada — as they are never shod they clamber the mountains like a goat —
                    altho we needed them much yet we never tried them. –––––</p>

                <p>After breakfast we continued our Route to <placeName ref="pl0682">Aross</placeName> thro a pleasing, &amp; agreable Track. we had the

                    to the surrounding green. About half a mile from the shore, &amp; still less
                    from our road we observed the appearance of a Cave, cut in a Rock. We rode up to
                    it, &amp; found we were not deceived. There was a considerable Cave cut in a
                    manner nearly regular, apparently <pb n="f.21v"/><fw>39</fw> the work of some
                    discontented Fellow. We found no pieces near it, which had the least appearance
                    of having ever come out of it. Altho it is now nearly filled up with Nettles
                    &amp; Brambles, yet, we were not prevented from going into it — it is about 12
                    Feet high, &amp; as many deep in the rock, &amp; of a form that appeared to us
                    to owe little to Chance. On the further side we found placed a stone which had
                    been square. but was render'd a little irregular by time — it was about 5
                    Footlong, &amp; 3 thick, &amp; seemed to have served as a seat — We attempted to
                    remove it but in vain. A little further on we saw another of the same kind, but
                    not so large — &amp; there was no stone within it. I should have added that the
                    square stone which was in the first Cave appeared of a very different nature
                    from the Rock itself. To what these caves could have formerly <del rend="overstrike">have</del> been appropriated we were at a loss to
                    determine, altho not scrupulous to conjecture — &amp; from Tradition we could
                    receive no assistance. —</p>
                <p>Just after passing thro a fine natural Grove of Birches, we met with a smart

                    now an opportunity — by going 2 miles out of our way to have it put on again —
                    walking over rocky roads had nearly lamed the horse, &amp; it was necessary

                    After passing thro bad road we reached the village, into which, I believe, never

                    people came about us with a stupid kind of Curiosity, without being able to say
                    a word — <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> walked up to two women who
                    were sitting at a little distance upon the ground — they looked at him held
                    forth their hands, &amp; mutterd "bawbie" which is scotch for a halfpenny — he
                    gave them one a piece, &amp; they burst into the most violent &amp; repeated <pb n="f.22v"/><fw>41</fw> fits of Laughter — &amp; went on with some kind of
                    work they were about, without taking any further notice of him — At this time a
                    young fellow well made, &amp; of easy mien stept out of one of the nearest huts,
                    &amp; asked us in english to walk in — he had been once or twice to Edinburgh
                    with cattle, &amp; spoke english very well — we could not refuse, &amp; he
                    begged of us to eat some bannock, &amp; drink a draught of warm milk from the
                    Cow; which we gladly did. The floor of the house was the earth, &amp; upon two
                    or three poles <sic>laid across some hether was laid,</sic> which with his plaid
                    formed his Bed. He had a little Library intirely of english books, among which
                    we found — a vol. of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0722">Blackstones

                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0237">Douglas</title></bibl>, &amp; a <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0067">bible</title></bibl> — at once
                    sufficient for his entertainment, &amp; Instruction. "It was not improper he
                    said, that a highlander should know Law." ––––– We afterwards returned into our

                    were here brought some salt dry salmon without any vinegar, which as it was

                    piece which was all we could get. –––––</p>
                <p>We had now no time to lose — we had twelve long miles over very bad road to

                    soon obliged to quit this as the roads were too bad for the Sheltee's Feet,
                    &amp; he could not get him along without difficulty — he jumped off, pulled a
                    long cord out of his pocket, with which he fastened the horse to a piece of
                    Rock, &amp; left him to feed till his return — he then run on before &amp; we
                    followed as fast as we could.</p>

                    fear than real danger, &amp; nothing was to stop, however it might retard our
                    Progress: After travelling about 8 miles we have a view of the <placeName ref="pl1084">Western Ocean</placeName> from the top of an eminence, &amp; a

                <p>It is with peculiar pleasure that I recollect this Day which I passed at
                        <placeName ref="pl3200">Toerloesk</placeName>. as I thought I had made
                    myself tolerably well acquainted with the Characters of <persName ref="pe2231">Toerloesk</persName> and his family, I felt myself at ease, &amp; trust
                    that my countenance expressed as well the feelings of my heart, as what I found
                    in these good people. <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> whose attention
                    to Character is of the most delicate kind, wore a countenance that shewd his
                    judgement of the matter, &amp; while his eyes glistened with the generous
                    treatment that we met with, he seem'd anxious to let them know by his manner how
                    much he felt it. –––––</p>

                    upon a visit there. Altho she had been educated at <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName>, yet she had received more from nature than from Art.
                    She appeard about the age of 21. her person was genteel &amp; her manners
                    unaffected — she was dressed in mourning, &amp; her countenance seem'd just
                    recovering from that kind of Melancholy, which a Sister should feel from the
                    untimely loss of a brother. whom she loved. Her voice was soft, &amp; her
                    expression clear, &amp; distinct. Altho she had no objection to talk, yet she
                    knew that silence became her, &amp; unless, when after breakfast she was telling
                    me the Tale of her brother's being wreck'd, &amp; lost on the rocks of

                    Eye — but she had two other brothers yet in <placeName ref="pl0697">America</placeName>, for whose safety she could but have some apprehensions
                    "&amp; surely, Sir,' says She 'not without reason, for they are good, &amp; kind

                    near 30 year, &amp; was now come to finish his Days in peace at his paternal
                    estate. He might be about 60 years of age — his Locks were becoming gray, &amp;
                    he knew it — "it was natural, he said, and altho the morning had been
                    tempestuous, yet the evening was calm." His manners are what you would wish in a
                    sailor rough, open &amp; sensible. His anxiety to oblige us gave a warmth, &amp;
                    force to his actions, that could but interest us. He had a kind of natural
                    levity about him, which was ever temper'd with prudence — He was never jocose at
                    the expence of Delicacy, &amp; he had that reverence for Religion which is

                    opinion, says he, that 200 years ago, the Highlanders lived in a manner equally

                <p>We passed half the Forenoon in a kind of Fascination, with the breakfast things

                    us in a walk. we took a view of <placeName ref="pl1084">the western

                    horizon of Clouds — or here, &amp; there an Island darkening the mist — among
                    which were <placeName ref="pl0974">Tyree</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="pl0896">Col</placeName> — we afterwards took a view of some out houses

                    himself — as his present one is old &amp; inconvenient, &amp; the spot which he

                    of being carried to shore, as he is of an immense bulk, he endeavourd to get out
                    of the boat easily into the water — but whether the boat was moved by design, or
                    in any other way, this deponent saith not — but in went <persName ref="pe0073">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persName> wig &amp; all — to

                    rather in it, for he wrapped himself like a great mummy &amp; as he never slept
                    with any cap on, his bald head, &amp; the rest of his appearance made him

                    sufficiently formidable — but whether from train of thinking the motion had
                    grown less, or that <persName ref="pe0073">the D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persName> had fallen a sleep, but at <persName ref="pe0053">Macquarry's</persName> four little children had passed by him into the

                    too much for the Children &amp; they all at once set up the most horrid trick

                    we have been able to collect, I do not know whether we are not justified in
                    concluding — that probably for the last 2 or 300 years, the highland poetry had
                    assumed the form in which we now find it — that the objections to its passing
                    thro the former 1000 years are innumerable &amp; that from the present state of

                    the most comfortable &amp; refreshing enjoyment I ever felt. I am informed by

                    One of them <del rend="overstrike">was</del> could speak a little english, &amp;
                    was the mouth of the rest — he soon asked us whether they should not sing some
                    Erse Songs, which we found was what they wanted — as it gave them spirits, &amp;
                    they could keep tolerable time with the oars. we were not a little entertained
                        <del rend="overstrike">with</del> with the songs, altho we could not
                    understand them, &amp; they confessed they could not translate them. I know not
                    whether it is conceit, or the real structure of the language but those
                    highlanders who know english, said, it was impossible to give the full meaning
                    of a great number of Erse words. we had therefore little else to expect besides
                    the music from our friends in the boat. It was easy <pb n="f.27r"/><fw>50</fw>
                    to tell whether they were singing war, or love songs — the one were manly,
                    rough, &amp; in a sharp Key —the other in a flat, &amp; many of them peculiarly
                    soft, &amp; soothing — one of them in general began, &amp; after singing two or
                    three lines was joined by the rest in a Chorus <gap reason="authorial" unit="words" atLeast="2" atMost="3"/> It was 12 miles to <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName> from the place at which we took boat — this
                    the men continued to shorten by running us up a creek, which separates
                        <placeName ref="pl1078">Ulva</placeName> from another Island, the name of
                    which I have forgotten,<note type="editorial"><placeName ref="pl2202">Gometra</placeName>.</note> &amp; then calling two or three men to
                    assist, they got out of the boat, &amp; dragged us along for at least ¼ of a
                    mile over a very rocky shallows — as we gave them plenty of Tobacco they
                    perform'd this laborious work with great spirit — &amp; we arrived at the north
                    end of <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName> about half past 10. –––––</p>
                <p>The appearance of the Island at this part hath nothing very remarkable — it is
                    high, &amp; rocky, &amp; we could not &amp; then see some broken pillars, &amp;
                    others which had an irregular appearance — there were likewise several small
                    Caverns. After cruizing about half a mile, &amp; turning a point towards the
                    East we saw <del rend="overstrike">standing</del> Jutting out from the island a
                    large collection of pillars as it were piled up &amp; laying in very regular
                    directions. I confess I never could have supposed such an appearance, &amp; we
                    look'd at one another with a new kind of Surprize. the pillars were perfectly
                    naked &amp; differ'd very little in size — all seemed of the same composition
                    which was of a dark ferreginous nature — most of them were pentagons &amp; they
                    were about 2 Feet in Diameter — there were several small islands of them, which
                    the sea washed over, &amp; which from the surf in bad weather render this part
                    exceedingly dangerous. We found we were to land here at a place which was rather
                    low, &amp; to walk over the tops of some broken pillars about 100 yards before
                    we could get a view of <placeName ref="pl1082">Fingal's Cave</placeName>, which
                    was still out of sight &amp; lay further to the east. –––––</p>
                <p><pb n="f.27v"/>
                    <fw>51</fw> The place over which we passed was not unattended with dangers, but
                    at present we had nothing to do with fear. We had sent the boat round to meet us
                    at the mouth of the Cave, &amp; proceeded <del rend="overstrike">on</del> with
                    as much expedition as a necessary caution would allow. As we approached the
                    Cave, the pillars upon the rock towards the island became much more regular
                    &amp; conspicuous — many of them were from 30 to 50 Feet high, perpendicular,
                    &amp; seem'd to Support the Island — we sat down upon some broken pillars &amp;
                    contemplated this Scene with surprize — but what was our astonishment when after
                    walking a few paces we came to a sudden view of <placeName ref="pl1082">Fingal's
                        Cave</placeName>! We did not speak the first five minutes, but alternately
                    look'd at one another &amp; then at the Cave — high as our expectations had been
                    raised they were exceeded, &amp; with a mixture of pleasure, &amp; dread we
                    could but reflect how small! how trifling! were the triumphs of Art. It is alone
                    by sight that any just Idea of the Sublimity, &amp; majesty of this Cave can be
                    conveyed. — At the entrance it is about 40 Feet high, &amp; 17 broad — the
                    pillars at the side strait, &amp; the top pointing somewhat in the gothic stile
                    — it grows irregularly narrower as you enter in, &amp; according to <persName ref="pe0008">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persName><note type="editorial">Joseph Banks's account of Staffa appeared in Thomas

                    men walked to near the end, but <del rend="overstrike"><gap reason="illegible" unit="words" quantity="2"/></del> not without great danger <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> peeled off his <add place="above">boots</add>

                    &amp; he was content to wait till the boat came round. We soon enterd the boat,
                    &amp; as the Sea was calm, &amp; favourable, ventured up it, filled with
                    sentiments of Reverence, &amp; Awe, which were much increased from the sound of
                    our Oars, &amp; our voices in the cave — the sound was not merely <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible">more</unclear></del> violent
                    but <pb n="f.28r"/><fw>52</fw> continued long — A number of Seal Fowl, old
                    Tenants of the Cave, hastily quitted it &amp; we were not a little surprized to
                    find a number of pigeons quitting their nests in the higher parts of the Cave.
                    The Sea was perfectly transparent, &amp; we could see Crabs, &amp; other shell
                    fish moving along upon beds of variegated Coral — it was still 12 Feet Deep,
                    &amp; there is little reason to suppose that the whole Humane Society would have
                    been able to have recovered us if we had popped in — this however we had no
                    intention of doing if we could help it — we proceeded so far as to touch the end
                    of the cave, altho, I thought not without danger, for a sudden swell of the Sea
                    often lifted us up 4 Feet, &amp; it required much dexterity to keep the keel of
                    the boat off the rough broken pillars by the sides. There were one or two
                    Elevations that I confess I thought would have been our last — but as the men
                    said there was no danger, I sacrificed my fears, &amp; sang three or four loyal
                    Songs, in which I was joined by a full Chorus — The effect from innumerable
                    &amp; long continued Echos was most astonishing — After thanking <persName ref="pe0008">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persName> for his
                    discovery, we quitted the Cave. The mind was agitated &amp; alarmed &amp; yet
                    endeavourd to tune itself to praise, &amp; to express itself with a reverential
                    decency — we were now less afraid, &amp; in consequence not less disposed to
                    attend to those feelings, which Novelty, &amp; which sublimity inspired.</p>
                <p>After passing round a regular projection of Pillars we enter'd a second Cave, not
                    nearly so large as the first, but as it was the middle Cave, &amp; the entrance
                    was an even square, it look'd full as well at a little distance. — it was far
                    more irregular withinside, tho it was neither so deep, nor so dangerous — a
                    great number of different sorts of Sea fowl flew out, &amp; the men diverted
                    themselves with getting one or two young ones, while we in vain attempted to
                    obtain some beautiful Coral which lay deep in the water.<pb n="f.28v"/><fw>53</fw> After passing round a projection precisely similar to the
                    former we enter'd a third cave, still less than the second. at the end under the
                    water there is an appearance of the continuance of the Cavern, &amp; it is
                    supposed to pass under the Island; &amp; to communicate with the sea on the
                    other side. During high winds, &amp; rough Seas the Inhabitants informed us they
                    were very sensible of the Islands shaking. This indeed I could hardly give
                    credit <add place="above">to</add>, &amp; you I presume at a distance will be
                    still less disposed to it.</p>
                <p>The pillars which are placed from one cave to another are <del rend="overstrike">placed</del> in regular order, &amp; are all of them from 30 to 50 Feet
                    high, &amp; of nearly the Same bulk — the pillars support about 30 or 40 Feet of
                    a whitish kind of Stone — at a little distance at Sea this part of the Isle
                    appears like a large, magnificent grecian temple, but infinitely more noble.
                    They could give no reason for calling on of the Caves, <placeName ref="pl1082">the Cave of Fingal</placeName>. –––––</p>
                <p>As we now stood in need of some refreshment we landed, &amp; ascended a rugged
                    steep place into the Island. There is only one Family live upon it, &amp; the
                    reliques of another, in all eight persons, five of whom were Children. The man
                    could speak a little English, &amp; one of the women, &amp; when they found we
                    purposed dining there they pointed out to us a little hill upon which we might
                    sit, &amp; sent some of the Children to fetch up the Cows. It was a very fine
                    Day &amp; we enjoyed our dinner — just as we had finished, a large wooden dish
                    of milk was brought us &amp; near half a basket of boiled potatoes, whether
                    cook'd on purpose for us I cannot say — the boatmen made a good meal of them —
                    the man, the women, &amp; the children with the boatmen encircled us while at
                    dinner. –––––</p>
                <p>The Island we find lets for about £10. a year feeds a few Cows, &amp; grows a
                    sufficiency of Potatoes, &amp; Oats, for the man &amp; his Family. They rarely
                    see any body during the winter months, &amp; are themselves exposed to great
                    Severity of weather — the Sea sometimes almost washing over them. <pb n="f.29r"/><fw>54</fw> one of the women made us understand, that she had heard a few
                    days before that <persName ref="pe2230">Lord Gordon</persName> was imprison'd,
                    but she added with a resolute tone, that if they dared to do any thing to him
                    the <placeName ref="pl0955">Uist</placeName> Fencibles, in which her Son was,
                    would immediately march up to <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName> — We
                    asked the man of what Religion he was. he said he did not know — he rarely heard
                    any thing about it — however he always carried his Children to be baptized at
                    the nearest Kirk. he knew some people who were Roman Catholics, &amp; some who
                    went to Church, but he saw no difference in them — one were as good as the
                    other, &amp; every one said his own was the best. Suppose, says he, getting up,
                    &amp; stretching forward his right hand, with which he pointed as he spoke to
                    three parts of the Island, every one of which, by the by, as far as I could see
                    was <del rend="overstrike">by</del> a direct precipice — 'Suppose, says he,
                    there were three ways of going off this Island, &amp; you said one was the best,
                    &amp; he, pointing to <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> said another was
                    the best, &amp; I said that the other was the best — why, do ye see, says he
                    somewhat warmly; we could not be judge of one anothers, &amp; we should all
                    probably get off well enough' ––––– there <del rend="overstrike">was no

                    <add place="above">is no reasoning</add> against this, says <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName>.</p>
                <p>After we had finished our repast, <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> drank some
                    new milk, &amp; eaten a potatoe by way of desert, we returnd to the boat by the
                    same way we came, attended by the whole Island, who wished us a good Voyage,
                    &amp; hoped we would call as we came back. We had pushed off from the Shore by
                    one, &amp; as the Sun shone exceedingly bright, &amp; we had <placeName ref="pl0651">Icolmkill</placeName> full in view we had a very agreable
                    Voyage — we could see a number of Islands at a distance, <placeName ref="pl0974">Tyree</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl0896">Col</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl1086">the Dutchmans Cap</placeName>, form its resemblance, &amp; some
                    other — there was likewise a great variety of Sea fowl swimming around us —
                    Several porpusses were observed rolling upon the water — but what diverted us,
                    in terror, was the sight of a young whale, which here they call a pollock, &amp;
                    which we were told at <pb n="f.29v"/><fw>55</fw> this time of the year was not
                    uncommon in these Seas. he was spouting up water to the height of 4 or 5 Feet;
                    of what size he was I cannot say I am sure, I saw full 20 Feet of his Back, the
                    men said 26. this was perhaps too much — as we returned we either saw another or
                    the same within 50 yards of the boat, &amp; as his head was rather pointed
                    towards us, when we lost sight of him we did not know whether he would not come
                    up, &amp; make a morsel of us boat &amp; all, which he might very well have done
                    — we kept looking by the side of the boat in a half serious expectation, but
                    fortunately the next time we saw him he was 40 or 50 yards the other side of us.
                    —</p>
                <p>It was a little past 3 when we landed at <placeName ref="pl0651">Icolmkill</placeName>. &amp; as we had nothing else to do than go, &amp;
                    view the ruins, &amp; were resolved not to take much trouble in understanding
                    the Inscriptions, &amp; Superscriptions &amp; all that, with which we were
                    likely to be plagued, we informed the men we should <add place="above">be</add>
                    in the boat by 5. –––––</p>
                <p>It is impossible to set your Foot upon <placeName ref="pl0651">Icolmkill</placeName> without feeling an uncommon degree of Veneration
                    &amp; Respect. The Soul hurries back into the past, &amp; views the pompous
                    parade of an unfeigned Superstition with peculiar emotions. It traces those
                    principles which could first induce, &amp; those fears which could continue, it,
                    &amp; in both it sees an anxiety that prompts <del rend="overstrike">to</del>
                    mankind to seek enjoyment superior to the present. At a time when Churches <del rend="overstrike">themselves</del> could be render'd sacred, &amp; any spot
                    of ground could be consecrated, it is little to be wondered at that the
                    neighboring chiefs, forgetting their former animosities, should seek to be
                    interred in holy ground — there was something soothing to humanity, &amp; to be
                    remembered for a length of Time in those prayers, which were believed ever to
                    find <sic>enterance</sic> to the divine ear, most often have calmed that bosom
                    which could have no pretensions to it from <del rend="overstrike"><gap unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del> repetition on its <add place="above">own</add> past deeds —</p>
                <p><pb n="f.30r"/>
                    <fw>56</fw> An old pert <persName ref="pe0524">Schoolmaster</persName>, the most
                    learned man in the Island, took the charge of us to point out the most
                    remarkable things. Full charg'd with a kind of Knowledge, &amp; a sort of
                    Speculation, we were soon obliged to lay an embargo upon his Tongue — we were
                    rather contented to be profoundly ignorant, than listen to the most absurd,
                    &amp; foolish conjectures. — The buildings seem to have been formerly very
                    extensive, &amp; there are now the remains of seven Chappels, in which I include
                    what was probably nunneries, &amp; monasteries. One of them appears much larger
                    than the rest (altho none of them seem ever to have been very high) &amp; a plan
                    of this is said to be laid by <persName ref="pe0066">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Colomba</persName> himself, who did not live to build it.
                    Within side the walls of many of these places are deposited, the remains of
                    Saints, &amp; heroes; &amp; the crozier, &amp; the sword were alike worthy of
                    being engraven on the stone, &amp; it was only possible to conjecture from the
                    emblems which yet remain upon some, tolerably intire, in what the bones
                    underneath had been employed. The ground within the walls, &amp; between the
                    chappels is full of Tombstones, at this time nearly coverd with nettles, &amp;
                    other weeds; we could get a sight of as many as we wanted, &amp; upon one or two
                    we thought we could dimly discover the Crown, &amp; the Sceptre. Tradition, viâ
                    the old Schoolmaster, says that several Kings from <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl2709">Denmark</placeName>, &amp;
                    two or three from <placeName ref="pl0925">France</placeName> have been buried
                    here — &amp; it is not improbable but there might be a kind of Fashion in it,
                    or, perhaps they thought their bodies would be long secured from deserved Insult
                    in that place, where prayers &amp; incense were ever ascending to Heaven — There
                    are three crosses still standing intire, which are called the crosses of <hi rend="superscript">sts.</hi> peter, John, &amp; Martin. Several others, we
                    find, have been lately removed, to render a market place honest, &amp; sacred. —
                    We are shown likewise the black Stone, upon which the chieftans of old use to
                    kneel, &amp; ratify their agrements with each other — &amp; it was very rarely
                    they ever broke them. It is pleasing to find the Hearts of barbarians <pb n="f.30v"/><fw>57</fw> holding anything as sacred, &amp; restraining their
                    swords when opportunity <add place="above">offerd,</add> because they had made
                    an oath — The buildings appear to have had a kind of regularity, for there is
                    evidently the remains of a good Street running thro them — We were requested to
                        <del rend="overstrike">re</del>turn seven small square stones round towards
                    the Sun, that we might meet with prosperity; but as this was not what we wanted
                    unless Heaven should think it best, we could but smile in the fellows face,
                    &amp; walk on. The fellow could give no account of the origin of this old custom
                    as he called it, &amp; we strongly suspected it was his own.</p>
                <p>This Island is called, <placeName ref="pl0651">Eye</placeName>, by the
                    Inhabitants &amp; people upon the neighbouring Coasts, &amp; the reason of its

                    search of a place to build a Church in, one of his people who first saw this

                    said the Saint.<note type="editorial">A reference to Iona's Gaelic name, Ì

                    fertile, &amp; in comparison with most of the Islands very populous. The
                    Schoolmaster had lately taken an account of the Inhabitants, which now amount to
                    260. exclusive of 20 lately gone to the west Fencibles. It belongs to <persName ref="pe0086">the Duke of Argyle</persName> who we were told had lately been
                    to visit it —</p>
                <p>A most brisk female of about 19, who could speak a little english, wanted to
                    return with us — She had obtained her mothers leave, &amp; would assist in
                    rowing the boat; 'tho as she seem'd sufficiently delicate, I think it was an
                    employment she could not have been used to. We were highly pleased with the
                    frankness of the Girl, &amp; the good nature of the mother, but as we thought
                    she might be rather an Incumberance to us in the prosecution of our plan, we
                    left her behind, not a little disgusted at our refusal. She continued to look
                    after us 'till we had got a considerable distance from the Shore.</p>
                <p>It was very little past 5 when we set sail on our return, &amp; as we receded
                    from the Island the different views of the ruins raised sentiments that were
                    both pleasing &amp; awful. When you are upon the Island they are really <pb n="f.31r"/><fw>58</fw> ruins too ruined — by <del rend="overstrike"><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del> a little distance

                    this Island before we set out; &amp; yet as amongst the present scene of
                    Confusion, &amp; Obscurity — little more than conjecture can be expected,
                    Perhaps, we had not much to blame ourselves for. –––––</p>

                    the remaining Chicken — we prepar'd this kind of Dinner, as dining on shore
                    would have considerably detained us — the men at the same time took their
                    refreshment, rowing alternately while they eat it — We were in hopes as it had

                    appeared like a vast body of Fire. the rays from which illumin an immense

                <p>In the morning we found that <persName ref="pe2231">Toerloesk's</persName> Family
                    had been increased by a <persName ref="pe2244">Lady M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>donald</persName>, &amp; her Sister <persName ref="pe2246">Miss

                    gone to <placeName ref="pl3200">Toerloesk</placeName>, with an intention to go
                    from thence to <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName>, &amp; as she had
                    never seen <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName>, she made all possible
                    haste to arrive at <placeName ref="pl3200">Toerloesk</placeName> before we <del rend="overstrike">had</del> embarked. She was unfortunately two hours too
                    late — would she could have divined our setting off, &amp; have arrived two
                    hours ten minutes earlier. –––––</p>
                <p>It was a fine morning, &amp; we had an agreable walk in the garden for an hour
                    before breakfast. <persName ref="pe2244">Lady M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>donald</persName> rallied us for our complaisance, as we had received

                    whirling a little Sailor hat which he had on his Head half round, said, that
                    there was no waiting for women upon a cruise, &amp; that through the overflowing
                    of his Complaisance, he had lost the wind for several days in the <placeName ref="pl1723">Mediterranean</placeName> ––––– this was to the point —</p>
                <p>I should guess <persName ref="pe2244">Lady M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>donald</persName> was in her 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year
                    she was of a form that was elegant, &amp; well adapted to the exertions of a
                    spirit full of vivacity — at the same time that her manner was easy, her speech
                    was flowing, &amp; sprightly — her wit, &amp; her wisdom were never at variance
                    — her eye was quick, &amp; piercing &amp; often conveyed to you the sentiments
                    she was about to utter before her tongue could express them — she was talkative,
                    without being tedious, &amp; lively without being ridiculous — when the
                    Discourse turned upon the late Riots against popery, she spoke with a delicate
                    &amp; yet a sensible Freedom — she seemed sensible of the importance of the
                    Subject, &amp; treated it with respect, &amp; deference, as was <pb n="f.32v"/><fw>61</fw> truly becoming — She had seen the <del rend="overstrike">Husban</del>
                    <persName ref="pe2245">Colonel</persName> her Husband but once, during the whole

                    &amp; he has since arrived by service, &amp; the Fortune of War, at that rank he
                    now holds — she spoke of him with affection, at the same time she said "he was
                    wedded to Honour as well as to her" — Altho she has mostly resided at <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName> during the six years absence of <persName ref="pe2245">the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi></persName>, yet she has
                    not appeared once at any public place — I thought I discovered something warm,
                    &amp; jacobitish in her principles when speaking of government, &amp; I
                    afterwards found not without reason. the Father of her husband had joined
                        <persName ref="pe0559">Prince Charles</persName> — whether he was in the
                    right, or wrong, it was not for her to say — he had engaged in it thro the
                    persuasion of his brother, who was with the prince, &amp; when he had once
                    enterd he was not so base as to retract — the consequence was that he was
                    obliged to fly into <placeName ref="pl0925">France</placeName>, his castle was
                    demolished, his house burnt, &amp; his estates forfeited — Her husband, by the
                    spirit which he has shown in the army, &amp; his interest in raising men has had
                    some, if not most, of his Lands restored, &amp; he <del rend="overstrike">was</del>
                    <add place="above">is</add> in hopes of having the whole — "the ruins of the

                <p>Her Sister <persName ref="pe2246">Miss Campbell</persName> was either silent thro
                    necessity, or complaisance to her Sister — true it is she scarce open'd her Lips
                    during breakfast. — </p>
                <p>We sat in the most pleasing chat till near one, &amp; it was with difficulty we
                    could prevail upon ourselves to adhere to a resolution we had formed, of
                    returning back as far as <placeName ref="pl0682">Aross</placeName> to Dinner. We
                    arose, &amp; after breaking with reluctance thro the most pressing invitations
                    for the sake of our plan, we were permitted to order our horses to the Door. We
                    now took leave of this good family, with the most warm &amp; hearty prayers,
                    that they might enjoy every good which a kind <pb n="f.33r"/><fw>62</fw> and
                    indulgent Heaven could bestow. We were again saluted by <persName ref="pe2231">Toerloesk</persName>, who bid us Farewell with a warmth, &amp; fervour,
                    that could only come from the Heart. –––––</p>
                <p>We returned by the same rough, untrodden path that we had come, &amp; as we had
                    no new scenes to contemplate we enjoyed that silence, &amp; those reflections
                    which persons must feel who are leaving those for ever, who have just begun to
                    interest them — It was in vain to attempt to get into any consistent chat about
                    the badness of the Roads, altho we felt it to the full; &amp; what renderd our
                    progress more tedious, &amp; solemn was, that within about three miles of
                        <placeName ref="pl0682">Aross</placeName> one of our horses lost his shoe,
                    &amp; we were oblig'd to walk the remainder of our Journey. It was past 4 when
                    we arrived at <placeName ref="pl0682">Aross</placeName>, &amp; altho we had
                    purposed to have proceeded at least as far as <placeName ref="pl1091">Scarlasdale</placeName>, yet there was no going with a lame Horse — &amp;
                    we were obliged to send him three miles to have his Shoe put on, &amp; submit to
                    the necessity of staying at <placeName ref="pl0682">Aross</placeName> that
                    night, &amp; enjoy the ride the next day of 20 miles thro the severest rain I

                    the neighboring rocks or as they sullenly seem'd to retreat from the Shore. It

                <p>Well, my dear <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName> &amp; what do you think
                    of our Tour thus far? I suppose you begin to find yourself fatigued with riding,
                    of walking, &amp; boating, &amp; seeing — but with a fair Sky, &amp; in pursuit
                    of Novelty every thing is tolerable, at least, &amp; however tired we may be,
                    let her, or him blush that first confesses it. How shall I conduct you thro the
                    next two days — we are to pass over ground we have before review'd — to have no
                    Sun to enlighten us — to be wet, &amp; uncomfortable, &amp; cold — you will
                    stand in need of all your Cloaks, &amp; all your philosophy.</p>
                <p>There is a kind of Sympathy which every Traveller expects to meet with from his
                    host, in case of bad weather, which 'tho it be truly of an inferior order he
                    would not care to lose altogether — Our host in the morning told us with a
                    smiling kind of pity that it looked very cloudy — that it rained a little —
                    there was something in the manner of telling us, that shewd a barbarous kind of
                    Joy — but we were not to be detained — 'if it rains water,' says I, 'we will set
                    off directly' — 'there is no living with a man,' says <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName>, 'who seems to rejoice at our misfortunes' —</p>
                <p>We mounted our horses, &amp; had the pleasure of being completely wet thro in 15
                    minutes — we had buttoned our coats at first, &amp; tied on our handkerchiefs
                    &amp; seated ourselves snug upon the saddles, with a resolution to be dry — but
                    it was all in vain — We had now 10 long miles to go, before there was any
                    probability of getting out of it — a considerable part of which, from the
                    badness of the roads, we must walk — it was not thro Showers we past, but thro
                    close &amp; well set Clouds, water spouts, &amp; whirl pools. The wind lay
                    directly in our Faces &amp; not a word sometimes for a mile together, could be
                    distinctly heard from us — save broken groans, &amp; deeply interrupted
                    sighs.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.34v"/>
                    <fw>65</fw> We were sometimes, it is true, seen to smile at our situation, but
                    it was by no means that easy kind of simper, which a person has when dry — there
                    was something horribly entertaining in it.</p>
                <p>After a ride of three hours we arrive at <placeName ref="pl1091">Scarlasdale</placeName> nearly stiff, but not very cold — we expected to
                    have had some little opportunity of drying ourselves, but unfortunately we found
                    the house full of people, met together to got to a Sacrament about 5 mile <add place="above">off</add> — they were too much taken up with their own fears,
                    to pay much attention to us — however as we visitors, we exacted a kind of
                    attention, &amp; altho I do not think, that at this time we were very welcome,
                    yet as we were very hungry we were resolved to <del rend="overstrike">exact</del>
                    <add place="above">have</add> a breakfast. — we took a dram by way of
                    preparation — you would have smiled to have seen what state we were in — our
                    clothes, wet, &amp; stiff, our faces becoming of a purple red from cold, &amp;
                    the pelting of the rain, <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> our hair wet &amp;
                    standing out at two &amp; thirty points. The dye of <persName ref="pe2190">Listers</persName> Coat, which was red had washed out upon his stock, &amp;
                    he look'd precisely as if his ill fortune had driven him to despair. I believe I
                    had nothing to balance this. In this trim we were introduced to some of the
                    greatest men upon the Island, &amp; among the rest to shake hands with <persName ref="pe2233">Sir Allan Mac<del rend="overstrike">lean</del></persName>, the
                    Laird of the family — we were not to be intimidated, &amp; went thro our
                    exercise like veterans, resolving to show as little of our state as it was
                    possible. I was placed on one side of the Table next the Lady of the house,
                    &amp; <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> on the opposite side next
                        <persName ref="pe2233">Sir Allan</persName>. — one <persName ref="pe2248">Mac<unclear reason="illegilbe">canter</unclear></persName>, a kind of

                    in a posture had it been upon a less serious occasion which would have excited
                    our laughter — he was a contemptible fellow, &amp; had no suspicion of it
                    himself —</p>
                <p>We received very respectful Invitations from two Lairds who breakfasted with us.

                    deference — this was not unobserved by him. As he had been used to it himself,

                <p>It continued to rain as hard as ever, &amp; as we<del rend="overstrike">re</del>
                    were very little drier than when we got off, <sic>it was not with much
                        reluctance</sic> that we remounted our horses. We had only 6 miles to ride
                    to <placeName ref="pl3195">Auchnacraig</placeName>, at which place we were
                    resolved to get ourselves perfectly dry. Our friends at <placeName ref="pl1091">Scarlasdale</placeName> were not to be frightned by the rain, &amp; altho
                    they had to cross a ferry of 3 miles over to <placeName ref="pl0683">Morven</placeName>. set off with becoming composure. Their plaids were a
                    tolerable defence — but what they could do with <persName ref="pe2243">Miss

                    to look at it. we had to go by the side of some lofty mountains, where the
                    clouds literally spouted upon us, &amp; we had no kind of defence but our
                    Integrity — this we trust remained dry. We went out of our road three times but
                    had the good fortune to be rectified. It was one, when we arrived at <placeName ref="pl3195">auchnacraig</placeName>. We could not help laughing at our

                    from the cold had drawn itself into the most laughable contractions — I believe
                    he did not think so, for he was serious — "We had better go to bed says he".
                    this was the most fortunate suggestion in the world, &amp; into bed we hied
                    without speaking scarce a word to each other — We were naked, &amp; cold, but by
                    covering ourselves up close, &amp; taking a dram we soon became warm, &amp; if
                    people knew what a luxury there was in the glow of warmth, I know not whether
                    rainy weather would be so much abused. We orderd our things to be dried, &amp;
                    in the mean time begged them to lend us shirts &amp;c. The people were
                    exceedingly civil, &amp; we wanted nothing they could lend us, we did not get up

                <p>— It was impossible we found to get this night to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>. — As there were but one pair of breeches in the house,
                    &amp; these rather small, I found I must either wear petticoats or Fillibegs — I
                    preferr'd the latter, &amp; I complimented myself with appearing like a very

                <p>––––– We made a most excellent dinner on some flesh of Red deer stewed into soop

                    <fw>68</fw> The person's name at whose we were was <persName ref="pe2234">Maclaughlan</persName>, a highlander in principle, as well as in
                    appearance; he was about the age of 50, &amp; of a countenance which 'tho rather
                    emaciated, yet was of a ruddy &amp; healthy cast — his hair was short, &amp; in
                    the true Roman cut, &amp; there was something in his manners which shewd that he
                    rarely employed himself in trifles. His eye was not variable, it easily fixed
                    itself on any object, &amp; seemed to me the Certificate of a resolute, &amp;
                    independent spirit. I had not reason to alter my opinion of him. After dinner he
                    saunter'd into the room where we were, evidently with an intention of having
                    some discourse with us &amp; we had not objection — some how or other we soon
                    began talking of the transactions of 1745 — 'I had heard, I said, that <persName ref="pe0559">the prince</persName> (for <persName ref="pe0559">pretender</persName> I <unclear reason="illegible">durst</unclear> not call
                    him), had been much attached to women — so much as to injure his Interests &amp;
                    affront his Friends' — 'Thats a Lie, says he, his eye kindling as he spoke,
                    &amp; they that told you so knew nothing about him — he was a sober, &amp; a
                    virtuous man, &amp; if he is not so now it is owing to his misfortunes — he had
                    few real friends, continued he — he was deceived." — I could only make a gentle
                    reply, for I found he knew more about the matter than I did. He enlarged upon
                    the Cruelty of <persName ref="pe0556">The Duke of Cumberland</persName>, &amp;
                    seem'd well satisfied with the Retaliation he had made, as it was by no means a
                    pleasing topic, I turned the discourse as soon as I could to an Inquiry, about
                    the productions of the Island; as the result was of a nature which you will
                    probably think not much more pleasing, I would advise you to rest a little from
                    your Labour, take another cup of Chocolate, &amp; put the Letter for a minute or

                    growing corn. The people employ themselves in rearing a vast number of Horned

                    this year, he said, were very low at <placeName ref="pl0226">Dunbarton</placeName> from 40/ to 70/. this was to be attributed in part to
                    the scarcity of money among the farmers, but perhaps more to the great numbers
                    of Cattle which are imported into <placeName ref="pl0775">England</placeName>

                    ensuing year would pay them for it. The horses he says, were not sold at all —
                    there were very few buyers, &amp; in consequence bid very low. He thinks it
                    probable this last branch will be given up intirely — Altho he could in some
                    respect blame the war for the effects which he had just mentioned, yet there was
                    one article in which the war had been of the greatest benefit to them — this was
                    the making of Kelp, which was very much encouraged by government, &amp; well
                    paid for by those who needed it. This article had been mostly imported from
                        <placeName ref="pl0697">America</placeName>, or the better sort from
                        <placeName ref="pl1202">Spain</placeName>, both of which channels are now
                    stopped. The kelp which is formed here is of an inferior kind, but it answers
                    very well in the end, &amp; it is said to be improving — It at present sells for
                    £7. r £8. a Ton. It is made from the Sea weeds on the coast, which are just
                    dried, &amp; then burnt. The Taxmen and Farmers allow to those that make it
                    about 30/. a Ton. — There is not much Kelp made upon this part of the Coast, but
                    as <add place="above">we</add> were going to <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName>, we saw the smoke ascending from several Islands which
                    we were informed was from the burning of Kelp. ––––– He answerd every question

                <p>The night continued rainy &amp; windy, &amp; as we were not above a mile from the
                    Sea, we had the full effects of it. We were well coverd &amp; had comfortable
                    beds but we felt commiseration of the purest kind for those poor souls "whose
                    latticed, &amp; windowed nakedness could not keep out the pelting of this

                <p><placeName ref="pl1077">The Isle of Carrera</placeName>, to which our first Boat
                    was to conduct us, was about 6 miles off. The Boat carried a Sail which in some
                    respect incommoded the Horses, &amp; as it was not very large, &amp; the sea
                    rough, we thought it no mark of Cowardice to be occasionally a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> fearful — perhaps we had no reason to be so —
                    but, I confess, I did not admire the waves now &amp; then wetting the seat on
                    which I sat.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.37v"/>
                    <fw>71</fw> Only one of the Boatmen could speak a little english, &amp; as the
                    rest often spoke to one another in Erse, the Tones of which are by no means
                    soothing, we were not the less anxious to be satisfied of our state. We asked
                    him if there was any Danger as the wind seem'd to increase. — he said 'the Sea
                    was rough' — was there any Danger? — 'not if the horses stood still' — this was
                    certainly precarious — we were by no means disposed either to founder, or dash
                    against a Rock, without timely notice, which it was scarce probable we should
                    have from people who did not rightly understand us. Upon the whole the voyage
                    over was not disagreable. We had not proceeded many yards into the Island when
                    it began to rain, and as it was foolish to think of sheltering ourselves where
                    there were neither houses, not Trees, we were soon wet through without
                    resistance. –––––</p>
                <p>The Shower was heavy, &amp; soon over, &amp; left us at leisure to cross over an
                    Island for its size, populous &amp; well cultivated, &amp; in appearance by far
                    the most pleasing we had seen. It was in this part about two miles broad. After
                    turning up by the side of two or three hills, we entered, by about half a dozen
                    small neat houses, into a small plain, thro which a rivulet found its way. The
                    mountains around were not lofty, but of a most lively verdure, &amp; near the
                    top of one of them which we were to pass over, several women &amp; Children had
                    driven together a great number of Cows, &amp; Sheep, to suckle, &amp; milk them.
                    We rode up near them, &amp; without saying a word to any of them, were
                    immediately presented with two large wooden bowls of milk — it may well be
                    supposed it was the best we ever drank. As they could not understand a word of
                    English, we could <add place="above">only</add> express our gratitude by signs,
                    which by this time we had learn'd to do tolerably well. They smiled, &amp;
                    mutterd a little Erse, which produced a Compliment of English from us. <del rend="overstrike">As</del> They perceived we did not well know the way,
                    &amp; they sent a little Girl to shew us. As we ascended this hill the Sun in
                    his beauty broke thro the Clouds, &amp; we could not forbear looking back with a
                        <pb n="f.38r"/><fw>72</fw> kind of envy at a people, whose Virtue was
                    Simplicity, &amp; who receiving all the necessaries of Life, freely again
                    bestowed them with a liberal hand. — By looking back when we were at the top of
                    the hill, we had a fine view of the rich vale beneath, &amp; of the people, who
                    forgetting us had resumed their attention &amp; Toil. In journeying to the other
                    Coast we passed thro several barley fields, &amp; two small villages which were
                    agreably shaded by trees. There appears scarce a part of the Island which is not
                    useful. A Satisfaction reigned in every countenance, &amp; the men seemed to
                    look upon us with a degree of Contempt, which <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> said he envied. The plains of <placeName ref="pl2719">arcadia</placeName> might amuse the grecian youth, but the vales of
                        <placeName ref="pl1077">Carrera</placeName> would charm its old men —
                        <persName ref="pe2250">Aristides</persName>, &amp; <persName ref="pe2251">Themistocles</persName> would forget their banishment, nor would <persName ref="pe2249">Socrates</persName> wish for a better Elysium. He might here
                    hold a closer conference with that Dæmon by which he professed he was guided,
                    &amp; sublime those notions which he entertained of Deity, to far greater
                    purity, &amp; with a nobler spirit of Devotion. When age hath placed wrinkles on
                    the brow &amp; the Locks grow few &amp; gray, when Desire fails, '&amp; the
                    grasshopper becomes a burden,'<note type="editorial">Ecclesiastes 12:5.</note>

                <p>Just as we arrived at the second Ferry, which was near a mile over, it began to
                    look again very cloudy, &amp; before we had got over we were nearly we through.
                    We were rowed over by a man &amp; woman, &amp; our horses becoming much used to
                    it stood perfectly still — We had after this a long two-miles ride to <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>, thro the severist rain I was ever in, &amp;
                    as the roads do not permit any very rapid motion we might be said to enjoy it —
                    we jogged along with the most peaceful composure, &amp; serenity for wet clothes
                    had now lost their power of discomposing our Spirits — we arrived in about half
                    an hour at <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>, &amp; in ten minutes more
                    were literally naked &amp; between the sheets. –––––</p>

                    <fw>73</fw> Just as we were dismounting, <persName ref="pe1685">Donolly</persName>, who was returning from his Farm close wrapt in his
                    plaid, came up, &amp; inviting us to Tea would detain us no longer in chat "you

                    'till within this last 10 Days we have not had a day free from rain this Summer,

                    felt. —</p>
                <p>We arose to Dinner about 4 oClock, &amp; found that riding in the rain had very
                    little injured our appetites — our things were tolerably dry, &amp; stiff — a
                    little motion soon removed this — <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> however we
                    appeared we did not feel ourselves uncomfortable; &amp; were steel'd against

                <p>At <persName ref="pe1685">Macdougal's</persName> we again met with <persName ref="pe2224">his Lady</persName>, &amp; <persName ref="pe2225">Sister</persName>, who received us with the most engaging hospitality. We
                    told them a short history of our travels which they seem'd to enter into with
                    spirit, as they had not seen <placeName ref="pl0652">Staffa</placeName> — They
                    smiled when we began to deplore the rain which had made us so serious — what
                    they were so much conversant with, they were by no means disposed to think of as
                    an evil. There is nothing so bad which habit does not render tolerable or even
                    endear to many. To be half frozen, half drowned, &amp; half starved, is only
                    worthy of a smile. — <persName ref="pe1685">Macdougal</persName> gave us a

                    &amp; would have given us a letter to the governor of <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName>, but as we had one it was not necessary. We were

                        <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName>. Altho it did not rain, yet the
                    Clouds seemed weighty &amp; low, &amp; brought on as if reluctantly an early
                    evening — a glow thro the broken spaces of the Clouds still continued in the
                    west, upon which the clouds ill form'd &amp; dark seem'd to float like the
                    wrecks of Chaos, confusedly sublime, many of the distant Isles were, at
                    intervals, dimly discern'd thro the mist, &amp; upon the mountains which were
                    near us we could plainly discern the white clouds float around, shaded as the
                    light could pass thro those clouds <add place="above">which were</add>
                    suspended, &amp; moving in the Air. The Shore murmur'd with the retreating Tide,
                    while the shrieks of the seafowl around upon the distant waves, added an horror
                    to the Scene. The Darkness as we slowly walk'd along increased, &amp; with it
                    our thoughtfulness. It was not time for trifling, &amp; if folly ever quitted
                    our nature it was now. Every thing around us was serious, &amp; interesting.
                    sometimes we were silent, &amp; sometimes we faintly expressed to each other
                    what at the same time that it oppressed, charmed, &amp; improved the Soul. You
                    my dear <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName>, can easily conceive what
                    thoughts should arise in such a situation — such, I trust, are those which we
                    felt, &amp; should in vain attempt to express. –––––</p>
                <p>As we expected a long &amp; a tedious day's journey we arose early. It rained a
                    little but fortunately soon held up, &amp; we had not more rain for several
                    Days. As we passed to the <placeName ref="pl0686">Falls of Connel</placeName>,
                    we had a noble view of <placeName ref="pl0685">Dunstaffage</placeName>, which
                    stands upon a rock, is well shaded by trees, &amp; seems to command the Loch
                    beneath. <placeName ref="pl0686">The Falls of Connell</placeName> are
                    remarkable, not from their height, which is not above 8 or 9 Feet, but on
                    account of their being Salt water, &amp; the excessive rapidity of the Ebb of a
                    spring tide. As this could not occur often in a month we had not now the luck to
                    find it — the Stream was however excessively rapid, &amp; eddied with
                    considerable violence over the irregular rocks, which form the Fall. It is about
                    a mile over in this part — it was some way below where we cross'd, &amp; was at
                    least <pb n="f.39v"/><fw>75</fw> two miles over — there was no danger in
                    passing. There is a kind of natural hole, about 10 or 12 yards over in the Rock,
                    by the side of the stream in which at a certain time of year a great number of
                    Salmon are caught — the water is in general quiet here, &amp; as it is a fine
                    white rock bottom, when the salmon come in, as it is supposed tired, they are
                    easily perceived, &amp; caught with nets. Such numbers are caught in this manner
                    as to make it well worth attending to. — when the Salmon are in here they are
                    said to be often seen with their heads very obliquely downwards, &amp; remaining
                    fix'd thus a considerable time, only quivering their Fins — some suppose they
                    sleep in this way, others, with full as much probability, suppose that they are
                    merely at rest. –––––</p>
                <p>After we had crossed the Ferry we found an exceeding good Road, &amp; had many

                    numerous, &amp; flourishing plantations around it — near it upon a mountain a
                    small Tower hath been lately placed which can be seen from a great distance —
                        <persName ref="pe1440">The Laird</persName> who is at present very young is
                    said to have estates to the amount of 1500£ a year — which in this country
                    implies, that at least they are very extensive. To think of quitting this abode
                    of Independence, &amp; Respect to search for the tinsel Honours of a Court, to
                    meet with neglect, or contempt, must be folly or madness — he surely little
                    considers his own advantage who upon any expectation whatever, condescends to
                    become the tool or the slave of another. There is a natural equality in man
                    which rejects with disdain, such a connection, &amp; whether it deserve the
                    appellation of pride, or a more noble name, every Briton has it in a great
                    degree in his power, &amp; ought to maintain it — but none that I know of have
                    so many advantages connected with it as a Highland Laird. —</p>
                <p>We leave the ruins of <placeName ref="pl3222">Birkaldy castle</placeName> to the
                    right, &amp; soon after come to the <placeName ref="pl2210">Ferry of
                        Schien</placeName>, which it was necessary to pass over — a man, &amp; a
                    young woman came into the Boat with an intention to row us over. She was of a
                    form that might be called genteel, &amp; of a countenance placid, &amp;
                    graceful, &amp; she could not I am sure have been much used to Feats of
                    Strength. <pb n="f.40r"/><fw>76</fw> It was two miles over &amp; would probably
                    be a laborious Row — perhaps she had been used to it, but she must have felt it
                    severely. I was now resolved that she should not touch the Oar while we were in
                    the boat, &amp; telling her to stand against my horse rowed over myself she
                    could speak a little English, &amp; often begg'd to <del rend="overstrike">row

                    <add place="above">by the time</add> I had got over my hands were blister'd —
                    but to have seen her toiling would have been far worse injury. — It was near 12
                    when we arrive at <placeName ref="pl2212">portnacross</placeName> to breakfast —
                    we were rather fatigued, &amp; very hungry, having rode 18 miles &amp; cross'd
                    two ferries by no means inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>After breakfast we passed by the house, &amp; thro the Grounds of a <persName ref="pe2252">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Siton</persName>, a very
                    considerable wine merchant in London, who is said to have several very large
                    estates — The House was good, &amp; being seated on a Flat the ground around was
                    laid out quite in the english Taste — there was an extensive park with several
                    clumps of Trees in it, &amp; altho mostly surrounded by a stone wall, yet there
                    was paling in many parts — in one view from the house, there were several
                    fragments of a whitish rock, round which several twists of rope were tied, &amp;
                    some honey suckles were set to grow over them — they had already arisen a
                    considerable way, &amp; had a pleasing effect — if the Improvements are
                    continued in the same style in which they are now going on, in a few years this
                    will be a most delightful spot. — About 10 miles distant from <placeName ref="pl2212">portnacross</placeName> we arrived at a ferry called <placeName ref="pl2219">Balguadulich</placeName>, near which was a house — we made a
                    miserable kind of Dinner here on Bannocks, &amp; cheese — the bannocks were
                    smoky, &amp; the cheese was new, &amp; poor — but whisky, a liquor which is
                    distilled in <placeName ref="pl0711">the Highlands</placeName> from barley,
                    supplied every defect — there is not a house in this country without it, &amp;
                    it was often 'our solace &amp; our stay.' — We continued our Route thro a very
                    good road, &amp; arrived at <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort William</placeName>
                    about 8 — Altho it was very little more than 40 miles <add place="above">distant
                        from <placeName ref="pl1076">Oban</placeName></add>, yet it was the most
                    tedious Day we passed thro.</p>
                <p>It was a good Inn at <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort W<hi rend="superscript">m.</hi></placeName> at which we put up, &amp; we rejoiced to meet wheaten
                    bread once more having never seen <add place="above">any</add> since we left
                        <placeName ref="pl1072">Inverary</placeName> unless in the form of dry,
                    &amp; hard cakes — At <persName ref="pe1685">Dunolly's</persName> I believe
                    there was a small piece which was left out of compliment, &amp; to shew our
                    affection for this Land of Oats. <pb n="f.40v"/><fw>77</fw> — on our way to
                        <placeName ref="pl2220">the Fort</placeName> I thought I saw an Eagle — it
                    was soaring high, &amp; I think from its flight, &amp; appearance I could not be
                    mistaken. — <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort William</placeName> is a considerable
                    Town, &amp; English is spoken with great readiness — in general the Highlanders,
                    who can speak english, pronounce it with much greater propriety than the
                    Lowlanders — they learn it grammatically, &amp; have not that disagreable Tone
                    which renders the Scotch Tongue so infamous. — The Highlanders generally speak
                    of the Lowlanders with contempt, &amp; prefer the English — thus every nation is
                    disposed to be at enmity with its neighbour, &amp; a traveller may be pleased
                    when his own is not altogether the object of detestation. –––––</p>
                <p>I had the pleasure of sleeping with two strangers in the same room, &amp; my bed
                    was said hard I believe Straw, &amp; very uncomfortable — but as it was neither
                    over the kitchen, nor were there any gnats to torment, I soon went to sleep
                    &amp; found it as good a thing for the purpose as ever I <del rend="overstrike">slept</del>

                <p>A considerable part of our Road yesterday lay by the side of <placeName ref="pl2190">Loch Linne</placeName>, and <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort
                        William</placeName> is placed at the head of it. <placeName ref="pl2220">The
                        Fort</placeName> itself has of late been suffered to fall into decay — a
                    considerable portion of one of the bastions has fallen down — it is now
                    garrison'd only by a few Invalids — we took a view of it by starlight, when a
                    perfect silence reigned within as without — over the Fosse which surrounds it a
                    draw bridge is thrown, which was formerly drawn up every night — as this work
                    would be now tedious, &amp; toilsome to the Veterans it is altogether neglected
                    — why should they raise suspicions in the minds of a peaceable neighbourhood?
                    —</p>
                <p>In the morning we passed by the ruins of <placeName ref="pl0205">the Castle of
                        Inverlochiel</placeName>, formerly a place of great strength but how long it
                    has been in its present state, we met with no one that could inform us. What is
                    singular is that it is placed upon a perfect Flat, different from every other
                    Fort we had hitherto met with — it was however placed near a River on one side,
                    &amp; we thought we could perceive the appearance of a Ditch, now nearly filled
                    up, on the other — this was sufficient to secure them from surprize — We now
                    passed by the highest mountain in <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName>
                    called <placeName ref="pl2206">Ben Nevis</placeName>, without seeing it — the
                    morning was rather cloudy, and his head was deep concealed in the Clouds — The
                    appearance of his base, as connected with other mountains, gave us no kind of
                    satisfaction. By the sides of the hills the clouds were floating in easy motion
                    along, &amp; as our Road at intervals led us under them, they now &amp; then
                    shook a little Dew upon us — as we had little apprehension of Rain, we were not
                    disposed to think this uncivil.</p>
                <p>We breakfasted at a house about 14 miles from <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort
                        William</placeName> — it was rather an uncomfortable one as we could get
                    neither milk nor butter — &amp; Bannocks, &amp; cheese we had had <pb n="f.41v"/><fw>79</fw> quite enough of. Fortunately the goats were brought up before
                    we set off, &amp; we had a most excellent draught of Goat's milk which amply
                    compensated for every other inconvenience — Happy is that situation in <del rend="overstrike">the</del> which those things which are disdainfully called
                    the necessaries, become the Luxuries of Life — &amp; there is a choice of a
                    barley Cake, or a bannock of Oats! — The Road to <placeName ref="pl0198">Fort
                        Augustus</placeName> was made intirely by the military, &amp; it is called
                    the Kings Road — it is <del rend="overstrike">a</del> broad &amp; even <del rend="overstrike">one</del>, &amp; several carriages might pass abreast. The
                    Country itself is rather hilly, &amp; cover'd over with hether — The spots which
                    were cultivated were very few, &amp; could ill have repaid the Labour — I much
                    question whether it is capable of Improvement — we only saw here &amp; there a
                    few Sheep, or goats browzing, attended by a shepherd whose appearance we were
                    little disposed to envy — There was in his countenance a simplicity, bordering
                    on Stupidity, &amp; a contentment, the genuine offspring of Ignorance. It was
                    little recommendation to us that kings once occupied his Station. If the Crown
                    of England had not been engaged, I know not whether it might not have been upon
                    his Head with equal Honour <add place="above"><del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible">with</unclear><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" atLeast="15" atMost="20"/> Kings</del></add> — he
                    might soon have learn'd to smile, &amp; simper, — learn a speech, &amp; make a
                    Lord; &amp; what has the King of <placeName ref="pl0777">Great
                        Britain</placeName> to do more? — It would be cruel to take him from a
                    slumber upon the Hether, to the cares of a Throne, &amp; the curses of a nation.
                    —</p>
                <p>As we were jogging along discoursing upon that Fancy &amp; Elegance, which taught

                    a Court, we were overtaken by a young highland Drover, who, as he could speak
                    english very well, immediately began to chat with us. This Familiarity we found
                    was supported by good sense — he was well informed, &amp; readily answer'd any
                    questions we put to him. He pointed to us the estates of <persName ref="pe1834">Cameron of Lochiel</persName> which were forfeited for Rebellion in 1745.
                        <persName ref="pe1834">Lochiel</persName> is said to have been worth 3 or
                    4000£ a year, &amp; to have joined <persName ref="pe0559">the
                        pretender</persName> with 2000 men. — His house <add place="above">which</add> was well situated in a fine glen, with large plantations around
                    it, had been pull'd down to the ground by royal order in 1746. <pb n="f.42r"/><fw>80</fw>
                    <persName ref="pe1834">Lochiel</persName> fled to <placeName ref="pl0925">France</placeName> &amp; died there. His Son, since the commencement of the
                    american war, applied to <persName ref="pe0465">the King</persName> for leave to
                    raise a company of Men for his service — it was granted, &amp; <persName ref="pe2253">young Lochiel</persName> was no sooner arrived at the Estates,
                    than that number immediately offer'd themselves — they were arm'd, &amp;
                    immediately order'd to embark for <placeName ref="pl0697">America</placeName>.
                        <persName ref="pe2253">Lochiel</persName> was taken ill at the time, &amp;
                    not one Highlander would set his Foot into a Transport — they would fight, &amp;
                    die, with him — &amp; absolutely refused going unless he went — He was
                    constrained to go, &amp; soon after died in <placeName ref="pl0697">America</placeName>. —</p>
                <p>About two miles from the <placeName ref="pl0205">Ruins of Lochiel</placeName> we
                    enter'd a vale — it was long, &amp; from its appearance seem'd capable of great
                    improvement — the hether which we had met with for the last two days Journey,
                    gave way to a coarse kind of Grass, which was formed into a kind of Hay, &amp;
                    reserved for the Cattle in the winter. In this vale I told at one view Sixty
                    little Houses, most of them inhabited, &amp; the remainder serving as outhouses
                    — it was impossible from the appearance to distinguish one from the other, for
                    neither of them had Chimnies, nor glass in their windows — they were not other
                    buildings, than the Just effort of Necessity would put together — &amp; I am
                    convinced that there can have been no improvement made in the place for the last
                    1000 years. This vale we were told together with another which lays to the right
                    of it, belongs intirely to a small Clan of the MacMartins, which, as it was <del rend="overstrike">at</del>
                    <add place="above">in</add> league with the Camerons, joined in the last
                    rebellion, &amp; suffered in some degree with them — the Lands were not
                    forfeited — All the Inhabitants of this vale, which old &amp; young could not be
                    less than 200, bear the name of their chief Mac-martin — many of the people were
                    laying upon the grass near their Huts in the most inactive, lazy state, alone
                    capable, I suppose, of being stimulated by Honour &amp; the bagpipe. Honour is a
                    word which the Highlanders are well acquainted with, &amp; pay infinite respect
                    to. A Highlander was called upon at <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> to give evidence in some cause. he took the oath,
                    &amp; was very positive in every thing he asserted — he was commanded by the
                    Court to confirm it upon his Honour — this he refused. "I cannot," says he,
                    "stake my Honour to a falsity" –––––</p>
                <p><pb n="f.43v"/>
                    <fw>81</fw> We did not meet with any scene, which we could with half so much
                    reason suppose to retain the appearance of the feudal times, as the present — it
                    is said they still continue to pay their rent by their services, &amp; as they
                    are not oppressed they do not seem at all inclined to change — it is one great
                    family, whose friendships &amp; resentments are mutual, who are united by every
                    tye, &amp; who upon any pressing occasion, would with the utmost alacrity
                    sacrifice their Lives — it is said, &amp; from every reason I should think it
                    true, that at this time many of them are ignorant who reigns in <placeName ref="pl0777">Britain</placeName> — "it is somebody," they say, "who overcame
                        <persName ref="pe0559">the prince</persName>". many of the songs which they
                    now sing were made in the rebellion, &amp; however the Laird may have changed
                    his principle from Necessity, there is no reason to suppose that one of the Clan
                    has followed his example. ––––– Just as we began to be attach'd to our
                    highlander for his openness, &amp; freedom of speech, &amp; his great
                    intelligence he took leave of us after informing us that we were now within two

                    we took a walk round it we found it to be a very neat intire Fort. We could have
                    went over it but we wanted Time, &amp; Inclination, &amp; we expected to obtain
                    the most perfect Idea of a Fort from <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort
                        George</placeName>. There is a very pleasant green at the back of the Fort,
                    &amp; there are trees within side it, &amp; numerous Conveniences for the
                    Governour — the walls answer exceeding well for the ripning of Wall Fruit, of
                    which there is abundance. To the west of the Fort there is a fine plain thro
                    which the <placeName ref="pl0820">River Ness</placeName> runs — its banks were
                    coverd with oats, &amp; potatoes, or a fine verdure — to the north a few small
                        <pb n="f.43r"/><fw>82</fw> hills were placed, upon <add place="above">one
                        of</add> which is said to be the ruins of a Fort made by <persName ref="pe1391">Oliver Cromwell</persName> — to the east is a fine view of the
                    Loch which is strait, &amp; reaches almost down to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>; &amp; to the south east is a lofty range of
                    mountains, which stretch along by the side of the Loch — upon the whole it is a
                        <hi rend="underline">pretty</hi> Fort &amp; <hi rend="underline">prettily</hi> Situated, &amp; as it keeps up a communication with the
                    opposite Coasts it may be deem'd an important one. neither this nor <placeName ref="pl0206">Fort William</placeName> were taken during the Rebellion, &amp;
                        <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName> has been made since.</p>
                <p>From <placeName ref="pl0198">Fort Augustus</placeName> we had 14 miles to ride to
                    a house called <placeName ref="pl0195">the General's Hut</placeName>, at which
                    we purposed staying the night — we were told it was a very indifferent house,
                    &amp; might easily be passed in the dark. We rode over a tolerable good
                    mountainous Road for about 20 miles thro a barren, bleak country, when we found
                    that Night was coming on apace — we had long lost the Sun behind the mountains,
                    but he now seem'd to have betaken himself quite into <persName ref="pe2254">Thetis's</persName> Lap. The Shades at his departure were not so sever as
                    we expected — the Sky was clear, &amp; the stars numerous &amp; bright — the
                    Aurora Borealis play'd vividly before us — Struck with the beauty &amp; majesty
                    of the Scene we permitted our horses to go at their pleasure — we soon enterd a
                    grove of which we had no expectation — it was composed of aspen Trees, &amp;
                    Birch, &amp; the road which was good had innumerable windings. Nature would here
                    have been perfectly at rest, had not a gentle breeze waving the topmost branches
                    of the Aspen produc'd a murmur divinely solemn. The path thro which we had to
                    pass was at intervals dimly discerned, so thick was the surrounding shade —
                    again <add place="above">sometimes</add> from the appearance of Light some
                    little way before, you would have supposed you were soon to quit the grove, but
                    you were enticed to a severer gloom, &amp; often to a Darkness that "might be
                        felt".<note type="editorial">Exodus 10:21.</note> After passing about a mile
                    we were at once alarmed with the rushing of water which hoarsely ecchoed among
                    the trees around. This was the <placeName ref="pl0196">Fall of
                    Fiers</placeName>, of which we had heard much, &amp; altho as it was a little
                    distance from the road, &amp; the darkness prevented our seeing, yet we felt
                    there had been no exaggeration in the accounts we had received. To describe the
                    Sensations which must now arise in every thinking mind at a Scene like this
                    would be impossible. Awe, &amp; adoration at once excluded Fear, &amp;
                    Superstition &amp; we passed slowly along in a silent solemn Reverie, often
                    stopping our horses to listen to a Harmony that would <pb n="f.43v"/><fw>83</fw>
                    have made the simpering Face of Folly blush, &amp; the canker'd Heart of Guilt
                    to beat with unusual Terrors. — We had now proceeded as near as we could guess a
                    mile &amp; half in the wood, &amp; there seem'd no probability of our getting
                    out — the darkness increased, &amp; as we could not well distinguish <add place="above">the</add> road, we were obliged to go very slow. As we had not
                    been told of this wood, it struck us, that we had either mistaken the Road, or
                    passed the House we intended to sleep at — either of which would have been
                    highly disagreable in our circumstances — it was now past 10, &amp; there was
                    little probability of our finding any house, or if we should it was still less
                    likely we should make them understand, either to show us the way, <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> or permit us to sleep in their hut during the
                    night. What before had been pleasing from its Novelty, &amp; the Serenity which
                    it produc'd, now increased our anxiety, &amp; diquiet — 'When Generals begin to
                    fear they think it prudent to hold a council of War' — we turned our horses
                    heads towards one another, to advise with serious deliberation. It was said,
                    that if we had mistaken the Road nobody knew <sic>were</sic> we might go to —
                    that if we had pass'd by the House it was a long 18 miles to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>, &amp; as we knew not a step of the road
                    there was every chance of losing ourselves, if-that-was-not already the case —
                    that to hasten on to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> with
                    ourselves &amp; our horses already fatigued, &amp; jaded, would be next to
                    impossible — beside we should miss the <placeName ref="pl0196">Fall of
                        Fiers</placeName>, one of the prime objects of our Tour — What must be done?
                    — We did not recollect having passed any house, &amp; as we had not seen one the
                    chance was, that if we did not meet with the right we should sooner find another
                        <add place="above">if we went on</add> than by returning. To think of
                    staying where we were was Ignominy, &amp; Danger — For we had not as yet learn'd
                    either to sleep abroad, or to despair. Our doom seem'd inevitable, &amp; sever,
                    but we resigned ourselves, to Necessity, &amp; resolved at least not to scold —
                    For what alas! what would untimely Reflections, &amp; or mournful sighs have
                    availed us, which nothing but Rocks, &amp; the murmuring grove would have smiled
                    at! — The result of our council was to go on, &amp; to call up the people the
                    first house we came to. The wood seem'd lengthening as we went, &amp; it was a
                        <pb n="f.44r"/><fw>84</fw> long mile &amp; half further before we had
                    intirely got clear of it. From the light which the Stars &amp; the Aurora
                    Borealis afforded us we could see a kind of Road which led us into a barren
                    plain — this we were resolved to pursue, &amp; had just turned our Horses when
                    we heard a dog bark — this, &amp; the crowing of a Cock, we had found to be
                    infallible marks of a house being near, we immediately turned our horses &amp;
                    fortunately soon after arrived at the house we were seeking for. The coarsest
                    Entertainment &amp; the hardest beds were Luxuries we did not expect to meet
                    with — they were thrice valuable to men whose toils, &amp; anxieties had
                    render'd them singularly the objects of Compassion — <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> however needed none, for he fell asleep before he had
                    finished a miserable Supper — when the beds were ready, I awoke him, &amp; he
                    hurried into Bed as fast as he could, muttering something about <placeName ref="pl0196">the Fall of Fiers</placeName>, as he enter'd the Land of
                    Silence, &amp; of Shades — As I was unwilling he should go without me I nodding
                    followed — Farewell the Toils of Travel ––––– Welcome Rest. –––––</p>

                    <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>. —</p>
                <p>There is a state of Mind, the effects of which upon the Body are equal to the
                    severest of Labour — The body becomes incapable of its proper exertions, &amp;
                    sinks under an oppression induced by the vehement, &amp; constant toil of the
                    thinking Faculty. I could entertain you with an explanation from various
                    Theories of the Nerves, which have employed the abilities, &amp; exercised the
                    Faith of the wise, &amp; the credulous — but I am sure, my dear <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName>, you would laugh at them &amp; with justice
                    too. ––––– It could not be merely the distance that we travell'd yesterday, that
                    tired so much. The variety of Objects that we met with might have had some
                    effect — but it was the exertions which the mind made, <del rend="overstrike">made</del> when under the greatest Anxiety, suddenly ceasing when no longer
                    necessary, which produced that inclination to Sleep not to be overcome. While on
                    horseback, &amp; expecting nothing less than a ride to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>, we did not feel in the least drowsy — we had no
                    sooner quitted our horses than we fell asleep —</p>
                <p>Whether it was that the Imagination was not inclined to be at rest within the
                    roar of <placeName ref="pl0196">the Fall of Fiers</placeName> — or that our beds
                    were so hard and uncomfortable as to permit no more slumber than was absolutely
                    necessary, this deponent saith not, — but certain it is that we rose with the
                    Sun, and as it was but two short miles back to the Fall we were resolved to walk
                    to it. We needed no guide to show us — we were conducted by the Sound, which the
                    Rocks, &amp; groves around reechoed. We soon enter'd the grove which the
                    uncertainty of evening before had deprived of half its charms. The boughs met
                    from either side of the Road, &amp; formed a delightful avenue — the road was
                    serpentine, &amp; there were several gently rising Hills — the morning was cool,
                    &amp; serene, &amp; the Sun rising in his strength threw a majesty upon the
                    whole — we walked along arm in arm reflecting upon that goodness which had
                    provided us with <pb n="f.45r"/> a resting place so near the <placeName ref="pl0196">Fall of Fiers</placeName>. — It was impossible to have as good
                    a view from the Road as we wished, we therefore descended a steep craggy place,
                    by the side of the Road, for about 70 yards — this was effected not without
                    danger, &amp; difficulty, but we were richly recompensed by the view of the Fall
                    which we thus obtained — we clung by a tree which grows upon a Rock opposite to
                    the Fall, &amp; commands it intirely. every time we lookd down the precipice at
                    our feet, which could not be less than 80 Feet, we felt a chilliness, &amp;
                    Horror, which we should never have expected, if a desire of Safety could have
                    overcome the spirit of Novelty. The Fall itself is about 50 Feet high, and
                    rushes down a very steep rock, without any interruption, into an irregular bason
                    formed of huge pieces of Rock, which seem to have been driven down by the force
                    of former torrents — the water of the bason looks dark, &amp; it imperceptibly
                    finds its way out, under the Fragments of Rock which surround it — just at the
                    bottom of the Fall a cloud of mist seems constantly to hang, sometimes, it is
                    said, in great measure to prevent your seeing the Fall. The noise which it makes
                    is excessive —</p>
                <p>Altho the weather has of late been remarkably dry, yet the water which pours down
                    is by no means small, what it must be when the bed of the River which supplies
                    it is full from repeated, &amp; violent Rains, exceeds any conception — it must
                    be one of the most awful objects in Nature — surrounded by lofty Rocks, rugged
                    &amp; bare, between two of which the stream over numerous obstructions forces
                    its resistless way, &amp; carrying with it large stones, &amp; broken pieces of
                    Rock increasing as it goes, roars &amp; rushes headlong down this monstrous
                    precipice — while the storm howls around, &amp; hoary winter on the darkning
                    wings of Evening, hastes to congratulate in grissly Horrors, this gloomy
                    Habitation of Despair — Death did he want a place more horrid, might quit the
                        <placeName ref="pl2661">Cimmerian Vales</placeName> for this, &amp; brooding
                    over the Fates engender Discord, pestilence, &amp; War. —</p>
                <p>We returned &amp; breakfasted at <placeName ref="pl0195">the General's
                        Hutt</placeName>, so called, because the officer who had the command of the
                    military when they were making this road, caused a temporary house to be erected
                    near this for his residence. We afterwards passed <pb n="f.45r"/><fw>85</fw>
                    along the side of <placeName ref="pl0193">Loch Ness</placeName>, a most
                    beautiful Lake, &amp; about a mile &amp; a half broad. The road is exceedingly
                    good, &amp; for at least eight miles is shaded with birch trees — we had been
                    informed of the ride, &amp; had raised our expectations rather too <add place="above">high</add> — it is true it is pleasant, but there is a kind of
                    Sameness which prevents the pleasure, which moderate road, &amp; raised
                    prospects produce — The Loch is beautifully clear, &amp; altho Fresh water, is
                    said never to freeze; which a man of whom we inquired the reason endeavoured to
                    account for by saying, there was brimstone in it — where Nature has thrown an
                    ill she ever casts an Antidote. —</p>
                <p>We had a view of an old Castle on a promontory, on the opposite side of the
                        lake,<note type="editorial"><placeName ref="pl0194">Urquhart
                            Castle</placeName></note> beyond which seem'd a rich, &amp; fertile vale
                    — there is a good modern house not far from the Castle, &amp; well shaded by
                    trees, &amp; which, I supposed, the Liberality of the Times has induced the
                    present Laird to occupy. — As you advance towards <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>, the mountains on both sides of the Loch become much
                    less, &amp; at 7 miles distance you have a good view of <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> upon a plain, &amp; a noble river winding its way
                    towards it. — The plain is extensive, &amp; altho for the most part barren, yet
                    we saw a much greater Quantity of Corn, &amp; better in quality than we had met
                    with for the last 200 miles — Upon a Hill as it were in the Town is the ruin of
                    some old Barracks, which the Rebels knocked down in /45. — <persName ref="pe0553">Macbeth</persName> is said to have had a castle upon this spot.
                    We were near 6 Hours in passing from <placeName ref="pl0195">General's
                        Hutt</placeName> to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>, we walked
                    our horses all the way, &amp; met with sufficient Incidents to engage our
                    attention, or employ our tongues.</p>
                <p>We dined, &amp; took a view of the Town, which is supposed by far the best in
                        <placeName ref="pl0711">the Highlands</placeName> — it is certainly by much
                    the best town we saw since we left <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>

                        <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName>, the prince's army marched towards
                    it, if possible, to surprize it in the Night, or to get past it again to the
                    South — but they found <persName ref="pe0556">the Duke</persName> so well
                    prepared that they were obliged to hasten back again immediately, &amp; arrived
                    at their Camp after a march of near 30 miles jaded, &amp; hungry — as they had
                    not sufficient victuals in the Camp, <persName ref="pe2255">Lord G.
                        Murray</persName>, the Commander, permitted numbers of them to go to
                        <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> to get provisions, engaging
                    them to return at a certain hour — some it is said did return, but many did not.
                        <persName ref="pe0556">The Duke</persName> knowing their distress, by a
                    forced march from <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName> compell'd them to
                    come to an Engagement about 11 in the Forenoon. a dispute is said to have taken
                    place in <add place="above">the</add> prince's army between the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Donalds &amp; the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>kintoshes, which sh<add place="above">d</add> have the honour of the
                    right wing — which the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>kintoshes were commanded to
                    take — The <persName ref="pe0556">Duke</persName> knew that several bodies of
                    Highlanders were upon the march to join them, &amp; particularly the Clan of the
                        M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>phersons to the amount of 1000, were within 3
                    miles — they were already more numerous than him — this pressed him to engage
                    immediately, which he accordingly did, &amp; as it was impossible half armd,
                    half starved, &amp; despairing among themselves to stand long; they all fled <pb n="f.46v"/><fw>87</fw> within half an hour, most of them at the first Charge
                    — The M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>kintoshs on the right wing maintained their
                    ground, &amp; behaved nobly. As if the causes which weakend the princes army
                    were not sufficient to insure a defeat, when engaged with veteran troops, they
                    accuse <persName ref="Lord G. Murray">L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> G.
                        Murray</persName> of Treachery, which they say is proved by his harrassing
                    his troops, sending some into the town, not hastning the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Phersons, &amp; his at length receiving the royal pardon — on any
                    impartial representation <persName ref="Lord G. Murray">L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Murray</persName> seems to have done his best, — but it would be
                    base to permit a Friend to fall by a less, or even an equal force, therefore
                    every circumstance is collected to make the force of Hell, if not of Heaven, act
                    against him. The Duke is here reprobated, &amp; accused of Cruelty; but as
                    (&amp; I was very particular too) I could hear of none cooly murder'd, there is
                    great reason to suppose that every <del rend="overstrike"><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" atLeast="5" atMost="7"/></del>
                    <add place="above">severity</add> that was exacted was necessary, &amp; <del rend="overstrike">un</del>justifiable; &amp; it is not improbable but we are
                    at this moment enjoying the good effects of it — that, you will say, is speaking
                    like an Englishman —</p>
                <p>In our way to <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName> we turned our
                    Horses two miles out of the Road, to see upon <placeName ref="pl0155">Culloden
                        Muir</placeName> the place where the Battle was fought, &amp; in our way we
                    passed by <placeName ref="pl3223">Culloden House</placeName>, which is now
                    rebuilding — it is agreably shaded by trees, &amp; bids fair to be a noble
                    edifice — it belongs to the Family of the Forbes, who sufferd much for their
                    adherence to <persName ref="pe0561">the King</persName> in 1745. The Country
                    around is a good campaign country but the Muir which is very extensive is
                    exceedingly barren — it consists of regular easy elevations, &amp; is coverd
                    over intirely with hether, a sure sign of its wretchedness — About a mile from
                        <placeName ref="pl3223">Culloden House</placeName> we met with a man who
                    engaged to point out the spot to us where the battle was fought — he said, that
                    as he himself had buried most of the slain, he knew best where to find them
                    again. His Ideas of government we found were by no means favourable to <persName ref="pe0559">the prince</persName>. "His ancestors, says he, had broken the
                    Laws, &amp; the Laws ought to rule Kings, as well as meaner men — therefore he
                    justly forfeited the Crown" — where he had learn'd this notion it was in vain
                    for us to inquire — it could not be instinct, for he was a M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>pherson.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.47r"/>
                    <fw>88</fw> About half a mile from the place in which we met with our guide, he
                    pointed out to us a number of irregular open spots, with a few stones laid upon
                    them, under which he informed us he had laid numbers of the dead. The places
                    were very distinct — as hether grew upon the spot, &amp; the grass which grew
                    over them was of a bright lively green, &amp; to appearance unmixed with weeds —
                    under some of these spots he said were 8 or 10 bodies, under others 40 or 50,
                    for as they found two or three, or heaps, lay together, they dug the hole
                    proportionably, &amp; collecting those bodies that lay within a certain circle,
                    put them in, &amp; cover'd them up. As the country did not Receive orders to
                    bury the dead till 5 Days after the battle, most of them were strip'd naked by
                    the harpies which follow armies, &amp; what he called the <hi rend="underline">Red coats</hi> or English, &amp; the Highlanders, were buried promiscuously
                    —</p>
                <p>The place where Barrel's Regiment was cut to pieces by the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>kintoshes, is clearly ascertained, by the number
                    &amp; the size of the spots — the major who commanded the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>kintoshes, is said to have been found dead upon a
                    heap of the red Coats — if the left wing had behaved as nobly, we should not
                    have heard much of <persName ref="pe0556">the Dukes</persName> cruelty. The
                    summer after the bodies of many which had been but slightly cover'd — <del rend="overstrike"><gap unit="letters" atLeast="10" atMost="12"/></del> were
                    torn up by the Dogs — they were however collected again, &amp; decently
                    interred. Most of the officers who were slain were carried, &amp; buried in the
                    Church yard at <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> —</p>
                <p>To review the ground where contested Royalty was fought for, &amp; where if

                    <add place="above">changes</add> of the most serious nature might have arisen —

                <p>It was with some difficulty that we recover'd the road leading to <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName>, &amp; it was 12 when we arrived at
                        <placeName ref="pl0154">Campeltown</placeName>, which is within a mile &amp;
                    half of the Fort. We breakfasted here — The Town is of a tolerable size, &amp;
                    has been intirely formed since <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName>
                    has received that degree of military eminence, which renders it unrivalled in
                        <placeName ref="pl0777">Britain</placeName>, unless by <placeName ref="pl1357">Portsmouth</placeName>. It is a very agreable walk to the Fort
                    by the side of the <placeName ref="pl3012">Firth of Murray</placeName>, &amp;
                    there is no high ground near it, altho we were informed that there was a rising
                    or two, which we did not observe, that commanded the Fort.</p>
                <p>The ground upon which the Fort stands was <del rend="overstrike">made</del>
                    <del rend="overstrike">a</del> presented <del rend="overstrike">of</del> to

                    Fort itself was built upon a plan, &amp; by the direction of <persName ref="pe0271">General Skinner</persName>. It is situated upon a point of Land
                    which intirely commands the entrance of the Firth, as the shot can with ease
                    reach the opposite shore. About 70 pieces of Cannon are mounted upon it from 32
                    to 6 pounders, &amp; several more lay ready if there should be occasion. The
                    barracks in the garrison which are built in the most regular order are capable
                    of lodging with ease 5000 en: altho at present there are only the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>

                    <fw>90</fw> you enter the Fort over two draw bridges both of which are commanded
                    by the Guns from the bastions, &amp; thro <del rend="overstrike">&amp; th</del>
                    two passages the gates of which are double, &amp; of an immense thick wood well
                    fenced with Iron. The walls are exceedingly thick — after two or three winding
                    passages you enter a large kind of square, in the middle of which are placed the
                    Governors House &amp;c &amp; the barracks — on each side as if were under the
                    walls are houses for the ammunition. At the most distant part from which you
                    enter is placed the Chapel, <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> which strikes you
                    at first view thro an opening <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible">thro</unclear></del> the middle of the Fort. It serves either for
                    Scotch, or English Service, as suits the Regiment in garrison — We were not
                    permitted to see the Magazine, which is walled round, &amp; has Iron windows.
                    The armoury is small, &amp; neat not containing at this time more than 3000
                    stand of Arms. we ascended about 30 steps, &amp; took an agreable walk upon a
                    smooth green platform all round the Fort. The Cannon were placed upon this,
                    &amp; seem'd to command every point; they are coverd by a breastwork thick,
                    &amp; strong, &amp; which having a step or two up admits of the use of small
                    arms over it, if needs be, with security. We had won the pleasure of seeing
                    bastions, &amp; Curtains, &amp; Sally ports, &amp; every thing which the
                    Ingenuity &amp; art of man could suggest for his defence — It is not improbable
                    that <persName ref="pe0554">Vauban</persName> himself might survey this Fort
                    &amp; reap instruction. It was begun soon after the last Rebellion, &amp; seems
                    well situated, &amp; furnished to prevent another — It seems an intire little
                    Town there are a great number of women within side of it, &amp; the post arrives
                    every day. We had a Letter to present to the Lieutenant Governor who
                    unfortunately was not at home, but we had no difficulty with respect to seeing
                    the Fort on this account — we merely gave in our Names, &amp; places of
                    Residence &amp; the captain of the guard immediately appointed one of the
                    Invalids to accompany us round. We could not help showing our admiration
                    repeatedly at the excessive strength of the place, but the invalid checked us by
                    giving an account of <placeName ref="pl3224">F<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

                    sufficient to entertain one another a la militaire — there was scarce an
                    engagement we did not mention from the battle of <placeName ref="pl3226">Granicus</placeName> to the affair of <placeName ref="pl2304">Bunker's
                        hill</placeName> — how each was lost or won, &amp; how by a different
                    position of their forces each might have been reversed — The causes of fine
                    valour were not passed by unnoticed, &amp; we gloried in assigning to every
                    ruler his true merit — It was Slavery that unnerved the noble breast, enfeebled
                    its arm &amp; taught it how to yield — while "the mountain Nymph, Sweet Liberty"
                    set <placeName ref="pl2679">Athens</placeName> free at <placeName ref="pl3227">Marathon</placeName>, &amp; taught <persName ref="pe1928">Hannibal</persName> that <placeName ref="pl1623">Rome</placeName> was not

                <p>In the evening we returned sedately to <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>. we passed by the seat of the <persName ref="pe0048">Earl of Murray</persName>, called <placeName ref="pl3229">Stuart

                    — it appears rather built for convenience than defence. The evening was calm

                    another little walk about the Town. There is a noble bridge of 7 Arches over a
                    wide, &amp; rapid river. The highland rivers are in general very shallow, or
                    irregularly deep, as they depend rather upon the rainy seasons, &amp; the

                    <placeName ref="pl0144">Fochabers.</placeName> After we had heard that so many
                    officers had been buried in one of the Kirk yards,<note type="editorial">Possibly the Old High Kirk of Inverness.</note> we could not take leave of
                    the Town before we had view'd their graves. I sallied forth therefore early in
                    the morning, with a person who knew well were they lay, &amp; who seem'd to
                    think it happy for the dead, that the Bed of Honour was for once made up in holy
                    ground. Whether the Town's folk were jealous of having so many armed men lay so
                    near them, or no, I cannot say, true it is that one corner of the burial ground
                    had been intirely devoted to them. There were few Tombstones erected, &amp; as
                    people quit at Death their public, as well as private enmities, there were no
                    reliques of them engraved — It was their interest to add the honest <unclear reason="illegible">man</unclear> to that of the Soldier, which I think is
                    done in a becoming manner in the four following Lines by much the best in the
                    Churchyard. — <quote><l>Here lays interr'd a Soldier piece in arms,</l>
                        <l>Yet form'd to relish Peace in all her charms:</l>
                        <l>An honest man, warm-hearted, generous, kind,</l>
                        <l>As Country, Friends, or spouse employ'd his mind. –––––</l></quote></p>
                <p>We often find a mixture of Vanity in that which should be the most serious —
                    several Tombstones, not indeed of the officers, were edged round with blue,
                    green or red paint. People seem anxious of securing themselves places, long
                    before their decease, for we saw several stones <del rend="overstrike">stone</del> set up in the Church yard which mark'd a certain space for the
                    property of divers considera<del rend="overstrike">able</del><add place="above">te</add> persons — many stones were erected with the name of the person,
                    &amp; his occupation, with blanks for his age, &amp; the time of his decease —
                    to have completed it an epitaph should have been added, which we had not the
                    good fortune to find. Perhaps this mode of disposing of themselves before Death,
                    may have a good effect upon their living conduct, &amp; a walk of a Sunday
                    Evening in the Church may have as good an effect upon them, as three sermons a
                    day. –––––</p>

                    <fw>93</fw> After leaving <persName ref="pl0156">Inverness</persName> we rode 18
                    miles to breakfast, &amp; it was near 11 when we arrived at <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName>. The change of the appearance of the Country,
                    becomes every hour more remarkable. it is now open, &amp; a great number of
                    small farming houses are seen, half concealed by a little clump of Trees that
                    surrounds them. The Hills rise with the most easy slope, &amp; the views from
                    the top of one <del rend="overstrike">is</del>
                    <add place="above">are</add> rarely obstructed by the next. our Ride however to
                        <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName> did not speak much for the
                    Cultivation — a black regular heath, now, &amp; then, broke in upon by a few
                    small farms, was our only object to the right, &amp; to the left was the
                        <placeName ref="pl3012">Firth of Murray</placeName>. The Country improves
                    much as we approach, &amp; from a rising hill within about three miles of the
                    Town, we had a most charming view of the Town &amp; its neighbourhood. The
                    Country was in many parts inclosed, &amp; was now loaded with harvest, as a part
                    of which we found here &amp; there a field of Wheat which I believe we had not
                    seen before since we left <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>, altho we
                    had travell'd thro 250 miles of Country. The Trees scatterd in different parts
                    were in their utmost verdure, &amp; <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName>
                    <del rend="overstrike">,</del> a small but flourishing Town was situated in the
                    middle of an extensive plain — these were sufficient to excite surprize, &amp;
                    admiration, in any person, but much more <add place="above">in</add> those who
                    had been so long sojourners in a most mountainous, &amp; barren country, which
                    absolutely refused the necessaries of Life unless at the expence of a Labour,
                    which excluded every enjoyment of them. — we for a moment doubted whether we
                    were in <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> — it must be visionary,
                    &amp; delusive; we found however that there was substance as well as we
                    breakfasted at Nairn upon the best bread I think I ever ate –––––</p>
                <p>The Tolbooth or prison in every borough, cuts the most conspicuous figure at a
                    distance — it has a spire something like an english Steeple, &amp; I suppose
                    designd for a terror to the Country around; &amp; perhaps may act more directly
                    for the keeping of an honest neighbourhood, than all the Cathedrals that the
                    Religion of <placeName ref="pl1623">Rome</placeName> ever constructed — Sister
                    peggy herself who 'mortally' detested the Fringings of her Brother peter's Coat,
                    goes almost naked here, or at least so simply clad, that were it not for the
                    visages of her Children, you would scarce find any vestiges of Religion at all.
                    ––––– <note type="editorial">Sister Peg was a satirical personification of the
                        Scottish national character, counterpart to the English John Bull, first
                        imagined in John Arbuthnot’s allegorical <hi rend="italic">The History of
                            John Bull</hi> (1712). 'Brother Peter' refers to a personification of
                        Catholicism in Jonathan Swift, <hi rend="italic">A Tale of a Tub</hi>
                        (1704). Pattisson seems to use Sister Peg or Peggy in a more explicitly
                        sectarian sense in his tour, to refer to Scottish Presbyterianism. See
                        Alasdair Raffe, 'John Bull, Sister Peg, and Anglo-Scottish Relations in the
                        Eighteenth Century', in Gerard Carruthers and Colin Kidd (eds.), <hi rend="italic">Literature and Union: Scottish Texts, British

                    <fw>51</fw> We thought we observed that the people in general are much larger in
                    stature <add place="above">on this</add> than on the west coast; &amp; I am sure
                    in this we could not be mistaken. This was by no means so observable with
                    respect to the men, as the women, who upon average could not be less than 3
                    Inches taller, than those women who are most strictly termed highlanders — It
                    seemed by no means easy to account for this appearance. It was conjectured that
                    as all animals which are bred, &amp; nourished in very mountainous countries are
                    of a more diminutive size, than those which are bred &amp; receive their food
                    from the plains, so it might be the case with respect to man, when in a mere
                    state of Nature, &amp; before those changes took place which are consequent upon
                    Agriculture, &amp; the arts of life — From the greater severity of Climate,
                    &amp; difficulty of procuring subsistence this opinion seem'd in some measure
                    strengthened — &amp; the growth might be stinted, for altho moderate exercise
                    invigorates, &amp; enlarges, that which is excessive cramps, &amp; destroys.
                    This last we thought would in particular apply to the women — in <placeName ref="pl0711">the highlands</placeName> the most laborious work, &amp;
                    drudgery is performed by the women from their earliest age, — in the east
                    country there is a greater civilization, &amp; altho women are by no means freed
                    from Labour, yet it is of such a kind, &amp; so equally shared with the men,
                    that is contributes to render them more healthy, &amp; robust — if they had less
                    to do, or were more employ'd in domestic occupations probably neither their
                    heath would be so good, nor their stature so much worthy of Observation.

                <p>The speech, &amp; manners of the people have now become much more agreable to the
                    english — fillibegs &amp; Erse are rare — we still persisted to call it
                        <placeName ref="pl0711">the Highlands</placeName>, which the people will by
                    no means allow "— what do you call a low Country says a man to us in angry tones
                    — here are no mountains — would you have it a bog?" ––––– The women cut down
                    most of the corn, &amp; it is pleasing to see with how much activity, &amp;
                    spirit, they use the sickle — if there are any men at work with them the women
                    always take the lead — Their dress is a short petticoat, and a light short upper
                    nightgown, instead of Stays, which are rarely warn by the poorer sort in
                        <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> unless on Sundays — their
                    pockets are tied directly behind them.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.51v"/>
                    <fw>95</fw> In passing to <placeName ref="pl1137">Nairn</placeName> we saw near
                    the road several very large stones, which had been placed in very regular order
                    — we turned out of the road, &amp; took a view of them — two of them were
                    remarkable, &amp; intire — they are placed upon a small eminence in the middle
                    of a plain. the first consisted of three circles of Stones, about 6 yards
                    distance from each other, &amp; from 15 to 20 in a circle — the stones were of
                    different sizes, &amp; most of them seem'd to have been formed into a long
                    square, &amp; set up on one end — some stood now in that direction, but most of
                    them were fallen down — The three circles were very distinct, &amp; the
                    circumference of the greater circle appeared about an 120 yards. — The second
                    which we examined did not appear quite so perfect — it was situated like the
                    other, but the stones were larger, &amp; there were two of them evidently of
                    greater size than the rest, standing together upright, which <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible">was</unclear></del>
                    <add place="above">were</add> placed towards the east. It is singular that the
                    soil is very light, &amp; sandy, &amp; there is no rock <del rend="overstrike">very</del> near from which these stones could have been brought — for
                    brought they must have been, &amp; placed up at considerable toil. We saw
                    several ruins of them at a distance, &amp; I believe most of them were within
                    sight of the Sea. There is no trace of there every having been any wood around
                    them &amp; it does not appear to have been a country ever capable of producing
                    much — at present it is very thinly scatterd. We saw no appearances at all
                    similar to these in <placeName ref="pl0711">the Highlands</placeName>. –––––</p>
                <p>The people can give no satisfactory account of them, but say, they were the
                    places of worship of the Picts — this they probably got from some gentleman,
                    whose knowledge he presumed gave him some title to conjecture — it can by no
                    means be taken as evidence in this case. The true cause of these appearances is
                    involved in the greatest of obscurity, &amp; altho Religion may perhaps be
                    assigned as one, &amp; with great plausibility yet I confess I am not altogether
                    for the exclusion of others. perhaps they were placed on account of some signal
                    victory obtained, or as the burial place of some of their chiefs: — for at the
                    time when they had frequent Invasions from the Danes, &amp; their only missile
                    weapons were a kind of dart, &amp; slings — many engagements must <del rend="overstrike">often</del> happen'd close <pb n="f.52r"/><fw>96</fw>
                    together — The coast is here low, &amp; seems to tempt an Invasion, &amp; we met
                    with no appearance of these stones further in the Country. besides I do not know
                    what foundation we have to suppose our pictish ancestry were so exceedingly
                    religious —there are no appearances which favour such a notion from the present
                        <del rend="overstrike">appea</del> conduct of the people, &amp; it is
                    moreover supposed that the most recluse, &amp; woody places were thought most
                    proper for the Invocation of their Deities. It does not seem evident from <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0569">Ossian</title></bibl> that <persName ref="pe0540">Fingal</persName> had much if any Religion at all at the Court
                    at <placeName ref="pl2431">Selma</placeName>, &amp; stones were placed always
                    around the Tomb of Heroes — perhaps in number according to the dignity of the
                    person deceased, &amp; in form according to the fashion of the times ––––– I
                    should not I confess have hazarded so much on a subject which I am sure I do not
                    understand, if that notion of the piety of the antients, had not bereligioned
                    every relique of design which remains — a place is sooner found, which is
                    confessedly not at all understood, but a dissertation on the Druids (who are
                    much indebted to these ingenious authors) is supposed to clear up the point —
                    &amp; silence, in veneration to our forefathers, gives a sanction to the whole.

                    is kept in exceeding fine order. We had the felicity of being taken for english

                    contrary. He seem'd well enough acquainted with the Country &amp; pour'd out
                    sparingly the little he knew, as we jogged along. The general price of Labour, I
                    found was about 8<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> p. day — in Harvest the women
                    were allowed only 6<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>/ &amp; the men 1<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>/. I could not learn the cause of the distinction —
                    for I am sure it is not natural. Most of these Towns on the Coast have some
                    small Manufacture, either in Linnen, coarse stuff, or stockings the price of

                <p>The Country is well cultivated. There are no hedges, &amp; even stone walls are
                    rare, owing to the difficulty of obtaining stones in a soil so light, &amp;
                    sandy we passed over but a small space of Heath in our way, &amp; that had
                    received the first marks of attention: we could plainly distinguish in some
                    places fields marked out by the plough, in others by the spade — when once a
                    people have felt the pleasure, &amp; the profit of Industry, it is not trivial
                    impediments that will prevent their eager pursuit after gain —</p>
                <p>We passed by three tolerable modern seats, but could only learn the name of the
                    gentleman to whom one of them belonged — a <persName ref="pe2258">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brodie</persName> in whose house there was

                <p><placeName ref="pl0145">Elgin</placeName> appears a town far preferable to
                        <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName> it is large, &amp; well built
                    but like the towns which we have lately gone thro, all the houses stand with <hi rend="underline">gable</hi> end — or narrowest part towards the best street,
                    &amp; so form a great number of little streets on each side — the defence that
                    they have for this singularity is, that they take up less room — this, I
                    confess, I could not clearly understand, nor if I had, would it have satisfied
                    me as an Englishman. Red Tiles are used upon most of the houses instead of
                    Slate, &amp; there were a few houses of red brick, which, upon the whole gave
                    the town an english dress. The huts of the poor, which we had passed by in our
                    last ride, were made intirely of Turf, very neat, &amp; much larger, &amp; more
                    convenient, than those miserable things we had seen on the west coast — they no
                    longer let out the smoke, &amp; let in the light, at the same door ––––– After a
                    slight refreshment at <placeName ref="pl0145">Elgin</placeName>, we set off for

                    concerning it, &amp; the ground near serves as a burial ground. we pass'd it
                    with reluctance, but evening was hastening on so fast, that it was most prudent
                    to make the best of our way. Near the road about a mile from <placeName ref="pl0145">Elgin</placeName> to the left, &amp; in the middle of a
                    cornfield stands a flattish pillar of one stone,<note type="editorial"><placeName ref="pl0147">The Pillar of Forres</placeName>, also known as
                        Sueno's Stone.</note> &amp; which as near as I could guess (for I rode thro
                    the corn to take a view of it) could not be less than 20 Feet high. A number of
                    little awkward male, &amp; female figures in strange dresses, &amp; placed as if
                    in procession were cut on one side of this pillar, &amp; on the other a
                    chequer'd kind of ornament. On the inferior part was an inscription, nearly
                    obliterated, which I believe was Saxon from the only letter which I could make
                    out, a C. — Tradition says some danish King was buried here, &amp; it is not for
                    me to contradict her — shall we say it was a place of <hi rend="underline">worship</hi>? —</p>
                <p><pb n="f.53v"/>
                    <fw>99</fw> It soon after this became exceedingly dark, &amp; as we knew nothing
                    of the Road, &amp; were fearful of missing the way we proceeded but slowly. The
                    Aurora Borealis, our good friend, once more came to our assistance with a more
                    than common lustre, &amp; formed a <unclear reason="illegible">Cone</unclear>
                    almost around us. The Stars twinkled in merriment thro the luminous veil which
                    was thrown over them, &amp; we passed cheerily along. We had however nearly
                    exhausted our spirits when we arrived at the Banks of the <placeName ref="pl0143">River Spey</placeName>. It was very wide, rapid, &amp; in many
                    places deep, &amp; altho in everyday weather it is crossed on horseback, yet
                    after a slight rain a Ferry is often necessary. We rode down to the River, &amp;
                    looked at it with dismay. We returned to two or three little houses which were
                    near, to inquire whether it might be forded, &amp; which part was the least
                    dangerous. We could only find a poor woman, &amp; <del rend="overstrike">she</del>
                    <add place="inline">Her</add> we had disturbed in her first sleep, for she was
                    both tetchy, &amp; ignorant, &amp; we returned to the River as wise as before.
                    The account which the woman gave had by no means elevated our spirits, &amp; the
                    roaring of the River disturbed a conference which became necessary — we look'd
                    at the River, &amp; then at one another; we thought; we knew there was danger —
                    it must be attempted, &amp; if we found the Depth too great or the Current too
                    violent, why — it possible, we were to return — it was a forlorn hope of our
                    beds, &amp; supper &amp; everything that was worth encountering Danger in a
                    tired, &amp; hungry traveller, was on the other side — It was resolved to
                    proceed — Just as we were entering, &amp; had proceeded a little way, in as
                    serious a mood as we ever had been in our lives, we though we obscurely
                    perceived something moving on a different part of the River — it was impossible
                    to discern the form thereof — we stopp'd our horses, &amp; soon after calling
                    out as loud as we could — "was it a resolute &amp; determined Note, Doctor?" —
                    indeed <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName> I cannot be positive — there
                    was that mixture of Danger, &amp; uncertainty about us, that I cannot say
                    whether it was a Flat, sharp, or natural — I believe it was a Flat — it proved
                    to be a man wading over up to his middle — we called him to us &amp; told him
                    our intention of going over at that place — He said it was impossible — but that
                    if we would follow him, he would conduct us over — &amp; so saying he
                    immediately tacked about, &amp; bid us follow him which we accordingly did,
                    &amp; he led us along way <pb n="f.54r"/><fw>100</fw> down the stream, up to the
                    horses belly — he did not seem at all inclined to turn over, &amp; we wanted to
                    know where he was going to lead us — <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> — we
                    were only answerd "follow me". — we were all apprehension — to be at 10 oClock
                    of a dark night, in the middle of a great rapid River, &amp; following a man
                    whom we knew nothing at all of, was a Novelty, but it had nothing of the
                    pleasing in it — add to this that the horses slipping now, &amp; then on the
                    large stones &amp; beat by the vehemence of the stream behind, began to snortle,
                    &amp; show signs of Fear. — it was not time to philosophize, our minds were
                    already made up, &amp; we were resolved to live as long as we could — The fellow
                    fortunately turn'd soon after, &amp; at once removed from our shoulders a weight
                    unknown before — Had I any revenge against any man &amp; power to gratify it, I
                    would set him on my horse, &amp; place his best friend upon <persName ref="pe2190">Lister's</persName>, &amp; the fellow who was before us, should
                    have led them a quarter of a mile further down the stream —</p>
                <p>We were not long in crossing over after he had turned — we thank'd him for his
                    caution, &amp; Care, &amp; paid him for his trouble, &amp; had the satisfaction
                    to find he was nearly as happy as we were — He put us into the road, pointed out
                    to us a Light which was <placeName ref="pl0144">Fochabers</placeName>, &amp;
                    then left us — the Clock struck 11 as we dismounted our horses at <placeName ref="pl0144">Fochabers</placeName> — we travelled more than 50 miles this
                    Day — &amp; if you have any commiseration upon us, after what we have met with,
                    you will excuse an hasty Goodnight —</p>

                    I produced another, which he return'd. I was ashamed — it look'd as if I had
                    designs to cheat the man — upon Inspection I found, that the Note wanted the
                    name of the person to whom it was to be paid — it had been written in red Ink,
                    &amp; the repeated drenchings I had met with had washed it out as clear, as if
                    it had never been written — The first Note I looked at was but a copy of the
                    rest — there was not one of seven of them which we dare put off, without our
                    Integrity being suspected, &amp; which if we had attempted to remedy, a charge
                    of Forgery might have exalted <add place="above">us</add> in the grass market at

                    were intire. This altho not much more than to carry us home, thro an expensive
                    Country, did not prevent a serious deliberation at <placeName ref="pl0156">Inverness</placeName>, to pass to <placeName ref="pl0825">Caithness</placeName> see <placeName ref="pl3209">John o' Groats
                        house</placeName>, &amp; — what dares not ambition! visit <placeName ref="pl0701">the Orkneys</placeName>. — we took a little map we had with us
                    out of our pocket, &amp; nothing appear'd more easy, &amp; upon Inquiry we found
                    it might with the greatest ease be effected, but at the same time we were told
                    there was nothing at all worth seeing — The Country itself had not a mountain
                    which deserved the name after what we had seen, &amp; we were not to expect
                    Novelty from a country so fertile, &amp; highly cultivated, as that thro which
                    we were now passing. To have gone might have gratified our vanity, but that was
                    not the only thing which we set off <add place="above">to</add> please — It was
                    unanimously resolved <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to go — At <placeName ref="pl0153">Fort George</placeName>
                    <pb n="f.55r"/><fw>102</fw> our resolution began to fail us, &amp; at the sight

                    boat to go ––––– we were now however incontestably at <placeName ref="pl0144">Fochabers</placeName>. –––––</p>
                <p>early in the morning we took a walk of about half a mile to see <placeName ref="pl0142">Gordon Castle</placeName>, a large, noble, modern building,
                    very extensive, &amp; well situated — The ground upon which it stands is by many
                    call'd too low, &amp; if as it is said many of the rooms are constantly damp, it
                    is certainly inconvenient. I should suppose this could be remedied, &amp; then
                    the prosperity, &amp; beauty, of its situation cannot be questioned. As you pass
                    thro a park towards the house, not indeed very large, but of a verdure uncommon
                    in such places, you have a view to the left of a number of large, wideshading
                    trees, &amp; pleasing walks, in an extensive pleasure ground — here &amp; there
                    the top of a grot, or bower, was seen, &amp; numerous small cascades seem'd
                    murmuring as they fell. The house itself was by far the best we had seem, &amp;
                    would have done honour upon english ground. I cannot however, I confess, think
                    it by any means equal to <placeName ref="pl3230">Lord Petre's</placeName>, which
                    with me is a standard of good Architecture. There is one Irregularity in
                        <placeName ref="pl0142">Gordon Castle</placeName> which, I think, adds to
                    the grandeur of the building — a part of the old castle which was lofty, still
                    remains about the middle of the building, which is now coverd over with the same
                    stone as the rest, &amp; forms a well connected part of it. we were
                    reconnoitring, &amp; walking round the house before six in the morning, &amp;
                    might have been very well taken up on suspicion — we had no defence in our
                    appearance — nor was it needed — The people at <placeName ref="pl0144">Fochabers</placeName> did not seem to have much respect for <persName ref="pe1442">Lord George Gordon</persName>, they said "the cause was good."
                    —</p>
                <p>We had a view of <placeName ref="pl0141">Cullen</placeName> which is situated
                    upon the side of a Hill, long before we enter'd it. it had a very neat, &amp;
                    pleasing appearance, which is much increased by a good old <placeName ref="pl0140">House</placeName> belonging to <persName ref="pe2259">The Earl

                        <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> who took him up upon suspicion —
                    The set of the curls, the brilliancy of the waistcoat, the cut of the Coat &amp;
                    the pretty insignificancy of the countenance, were sufficient grounds, but when
                    he open'd his mouth every doubt vanished for he spoke <pb n="f.55v"/><fw>103</fw> "an infinite deal of nothing", or nonsense, if you please,
                    much to <persName ref="pe2190">Lister's</persName> entertainment, who had fallen
                    into discourse with him. The civility extended so far as to promise us his

                    while — we could not stay that little while &amp; consequently lost his company
                    with little regret. — As it was Sunday we purposed if possible to arrive at
                        <placeName ref="pl0136">Bamff</placeName> by Service time, this however we
                    did not, for we were deceived with respect to the Hour, &amp; I do not believe
                    we should have gain'd more than by a serious review of our thoughts. –––––</p>
                <p>The Country between <placeName ref="pl0141">Cullen</placeName>, &amp; <placeName ref="pl0136">Bamff</placeName> is rich, &amp; beautiful, &amp; the fields
                    were now clothed with yellow. the harvest was in some few places begun. About
                    four miles from <placeName ref="pl0141">Cullen</placeName>, we dismounted to
                    take a walk a little way from the road, to see the Remains of <placeName ref="pl0125">Byne Castle</placeName>. It stands in a vale upon a rocky
                    eminence about 150 yards from the road — it is Indeed nearly concealed by an
                    orchard, which at this time grows upon higher ground before it. One end of the
                    vale terminates in the Sea at about half a mile distance. The Rocks at some
                    small distance around are coverd with old Trees. We passed thro the orchard
                    which is well stored in going to it, &amp; were permitted by the old man who
                    accompanied us to take a liberal supply of apples, which I do assure you, we
                    found <del rend="overstrike">a</del> most refreshing <del rend="overstrike">thing</del> on our Journey. — The Castle belonged, &amp; the ruins of it I
                    believe are now restored, to the Ogilvy Family, &amp; was knocked down for the
                    attachment of its master to <persName ref="pe1558">the pretender</persName> in
                    1715. The ruins are large, &amp; noble, &amp; altho from its appearance it must
                    have been very antient, yet I think it would have defied Time another Century or
                    two — but Rebellion is quicker in its consequences — the battle of <placeName ref="pl3211">Sherifmuir</placeName><note type="editorial">The Battle of

                        and effectively ended James Francis Edward Stuart's attempt on the British

                    marriage, or the more important events of Life — Our guide was born two years

                    married 18 years after it. This mode of Calculation appears exceedingly natural,
                    &amp; in the lesser concerns of Life we always make use of something equivalent
                    — it little therefore to be wonder'd at that this man should so calculate, who
                    by his appearance &amp; stupidity, I dare say had neither heard of <persName ref="pe2260">Adam</persName>

                    <fw>104</fw> As the Country is open, every town is for the most part seen long
                    before you come at it. This was not the Case with <placeName ref="pl0136">Bamff</placeName> — a rising Hill prevented the view, till we came within
                    two short miles of it. Our Eyes had been before intent on a Town, called
                        <placeName ref="pl3231">Down</placeName>, on the opposite shore which we had
                    mistaken for <placeName ref="pl0136">Bamff</placeName>, so that we came upon
                        <placeName ref="pl0136">Bamff</placeName> by surprize. The Town is long,
                    &amp; tolerably well built, &amp; we had to pass directly thro it before we
                    arrived at our Inn. After Dinner we attempted to get a view of the seat &amp;
                    grounds of <persName ref="pe0090">the Earl of Fife</persName>
                    <gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" atLeast="2" atMost="3"/> which was
                    prohibited, altho the woman who had done it, seem'd to repent of it afterwards.
                    We should not have been so anxious if we had not been told that it was equal if
                    not superior to <placeName ref="pe0088">the Duke of Gordon's</placeName>, which
                    is by no means the case. We afterwards passed a good bridge, &amp; ascended a
                    hill not far from the house of which we had a tolerable View, from a kind of
                    rough Temple, set up as a view from the house. It has no pretension to stand in
                    any competition with <placeName ref="pl0142">Gordon Castle</placeName> — it is a
                    lofty square house placed upon a Flat with no Trees near it, &amp; no sensible
                    road up to it. It has no proper Fronts, &amp; a few paltry bake houses or
                    offices, which are placed naked at one corner, turn to you at ever view. The
                    house was of white stone cover'd with Slate, but the little huts, were of hewn
                    stone coverd with fine burnished red Tiles. –––––</p>
                <p>We purposed to have slept to Night at a place call'd <placeName ref="pl3232">Chapple Liggot</placeName>: but before we had got half way there, my horse
                    lost his Shoe, &amp; soon became so lame that I was obliged to get down &amp;
                    walk — it was quite dark when we arrived at <placeName ref="pl1154">Turriff</placeName>, where, not unwelcome guests we took up our Quarters
                    for the night — It is true the bed was hard, &amp;, I believe, of matted Straw,
                    but it was large, &amp; that was sufficient — <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> who slept in another room thinks he slept upon a board,
                    which indeed with clean Linnen over it, serves very well when it is once warmed,
                    &amp; might with propriety be deemed a Luxury to a man who had been used to
                    sleep upon a Rock; but in every other case it bears the name, &amp; the reality
                    of a hardship — 'tho <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> did not feel it. —

                <p>There is one advantage to sleeping upon a hard bed, that your dreams are never
                    like to be of a warm, &amp; fiery nature — there is not that heat which sets the
                    blood in a ferment, &amp; does more to disturb the Imagination, than all the
                        <sic>Sylps</sic>, &amp; Gnomes which <persName ref="pe2261">Baxter</persName> has invented, let them be in their nature ever so
                    venemous, or their probosces of a length equal to the Elephants; or what perhaps
                    would better suit with <persName ref="pe2261">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                        Baxter</persName>, equal to that of a bumble Bee, or a large Blue bottle

                        caused by external beings invading and disordering the soul during sleep.
                        Though clearly dismissive of Baxter's theory, Pattisson was interested in
                        the subject, submitting an essay on 'Sleep and Dreaming' during his

                    not impeded — in short if you think right when you go to bed, you may be sure of
                    thinking the same almost all night long — which is by no means the case in a
                    feather Bed — you are not in that total kind of stupefaction, &amp; Fraction,
                    which has been justly termed a kind of Death — for the hardships of the Body,
                    keep the soul in some sort of Obedience to the will — &amp; the will being
                    granted in the first instance to be right, it follows that all its operations
                    must be so. I need scared add that there is no temptation to lay long in the
                    morning, which to a traveller might often be attended with Inconveniences, &amp;
                    to one that sleeps at home is an inducement to neglect his Employ. The antients
                    had little merit in that old Maxim <l>He that would thrive</l>
                    <l>Must rise by five.</l> It would be difficult to lay longer upon a hard bed —
                    which appears to me to be the cause of the Celebrity — of our renowned
                    Ancestors, who by this kind of Regimen could not fail to have clear Heads, warm
                    breasts, &amp; nervous arms; &amp; may we not account for all the failings of
                    these degenerate times by the use of soft Beds? The warm soft Bed is certainly
                    neither an encourager of Morality, or Industry, &amp; this at once becomes a
                    public as well as a private concern, &amp; if our men of parliament who profess
                    to <pb n="f.57r"/><fw>106</fw> assemble, &amp; deliberate for the good of their
                    country, would but once act up to the spirit of their station, they would bring
                    in a bill for the prohibition of soft beds under certain regulations. Could you
                    not hint this to <persName ref="pe0277">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                        Strutt</persName> who, I am sure, has as much the good of this flourishing

                    soon have? &amp; I trust there would soon be a man rise worthy to take <persName ref="pe0347">Lord North's</persName> station. If <persName ref="pe0277">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Strutt</persName> does not think this a

                <p>We arose early, &amp; refreshed, &amp; were resolved to redeem the misfortune of
                    yesterday by a ride of eighteen long miles to breakfast. (While I was copying my
                    Journal from my memory in a room at <placeName ref="pl0318">Aberbrothic</placeName>, I was disturbed by the 'harmonyd wine' of two
                    priggs, playing at back gammon in the same Room. I find by journal I was very
                    angry at the time, &amp; had a great mind in revenge to take down their
                    occassional remarks. Their alternate success, &amp; disgrace was the source of
                    much laughter, &amp; libation, on one side, &amp; on the other the most violent
                    &amp; ill intended attacks upon Fortune, as if she, who was ever blind, could be
                    partial. I was too ill temperd to write nonsense, &amp; I had not knibb'd my pen
                    broad enough for <del rend="overstrike"><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" atLeast="12" atMost="15"/></del>
                    <add place="above">Resentment.</add> I could not write any thing, that was clear
                    — so I arose &amp; walk'd up &amp; down the Room singing with as much ease as
                    suited the occasion, a song, &amp; in such a Key note as I though would give
                    them most disturbance. This, I believe, had its proper effect for they grew
                    silent by degrees which I interpreted to <add place="above">the</add> kindly
                    influence of my music — I increased half a note, &amp; in about 15 minutes had
                    the pleasure of seeing them retreat in confusion — they were literally defeated
                    — I hymn'd an ode of triumph, took up my pen, returned to <placeName ref="pl1154">Turriff</placeName>, &amp; the Journal went on as follows.)
                    ––––– Our Landlord took us to see the hunting Lodge, a small neat building, <del rend="overstrike">built</del> erected by a Club of Gentlemen, of which
                        <persName ref="pe0088">the Duke of Gordon</persName> is president. It
                    consists merely of a large Dinner Room, &amp; an elegant card Room, in this
                    latter are placed the portraits of <pb n="f.57v"/><fw>107</fw> persons, whose
                    merit it was to live some thirty or forty years beyond the common measurement.
                    The man indeed is said to have lived to the age of 131 years, &amp; enjoy'd the
                    faculties of an old man till the last. — I am much inclined to doubt the
                    calculation of a poor man with respect to his age, &amp; especially where as in
                        <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> there seems no legal way of
                    ascertaining it — where priests are scarce, &amp; people not religious, baptism
                    is scarcely though of as necessary; &amp; even should that be the case the
                    Register may be improperly marked, or a forefather, or namesake may easily be
                    taken for the person, whose age is in dispute — add to this the vanity which a
                    man has in his age — it proves his regularity; &amp; Temperance, flatters the
                    long life of his offspring — his neighbours are pleased with the Rocks, &amp;
                    the Oats, &amp; the Climate, which can cherish, &amp; support such a phenomenon,
                    &amp; nobody can contradict his authority. Wisdom is in all cases allowed to
                    comfort the feelings of a gray infirmity — for it is clear, they might have been
                    wise — many of them are reputed so with Justice, all of them as a compliment. In
                    nations uncivilized their consequence is astonishing, &amp; if he who has
                    instructed two generations is wise how much more so must he be who has taught
                    four! — in short as we did not covet the age of <persName ref="pe2262">Methuselah</persName>, we had reasoned ourselves into a belief that none
                    exceed fairly 90, or 100 at most — we felt a satisfaction in our Infidelity,
                    &amp; were riding along as persons do in such circumstances with an ease, &amp;
                    uprightness, that we thought became us, when we overtook an old man walking <del rend="overstrike">along</del> a tolerable pace. he was quite blind with age,
                    and was led by a string by a little girl. his face was the most perfect antique,
                    &amp; we should certainly have taken him for Time if he had not been blind, or
                    we could have seen his hour Glass — we spoke to him, <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> he heard with ease &amp; answerd with firmness. His name was
                        <persName ref="pe2263">Charles Leslie</persName> an old soldier &amp; he was
                    born 30 years before the battle of <placeName ref="pl3211">Sherifmuir</placeName>, — he must therefore now be 95 years old. We should
                    certainly have been instantly converted if we had not reasoned upon it before,
                    &amp; even as it was — we had equal mind to alter our opinion — I believe we did
                    not. — for says <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> he can never live four
                    years longer, &amp; then he would be within the 100 — true, says I, &amp; he has
                    no Register but his Face: ––––– we rode on &amp; were silent –––––</p>
                <p>The Town of <placeName ref="pl1155">Old Meldrum</placeName> has like the rest of

                    approved by the old, &amp; the young have no objection to their absence. In many
                    of the Fields near the Town little circles were formed on the grass, &amp;, I
                    dare say, the news of the parish discussed with much fervor, &amp; sincerity to
                    improve it, as at a Coterie in <placeName ref="pl1105">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> James</placeName>, or in a company of prattlers at M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> _____.</p>
                <p>— I will certainly learn to knit before I grow old, that if it please Heaven I
                    should arrive at that honourable station, I may have some kind of amusement, or
                    at least be in a small degree profitable to the world, while by my experience I
                    may entertain; or instruct it — "&amp; when" says <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> who has formed the same Resolution "we feel ourselves
                    tetchy, &amp; vexed, with the behaviour, &amp; actions of an untoward

                    &amp; the lively, it shall run off, like the electrical spark, from the points
                    of the knitting pins into the Stocking — &amp; that you know ill not be the

                <p>Our Ride from <placeName ref="pl1155">Old Meldrum</placeName> to <placeName ref="pl0128">Aberdeen</placeName>, was thro a country full as populous as we

                    near a quarter of a mile into the Sea in a direction rather curved so as to be

                    pounders, situated near the pier, but which from the building of the pier can be
                    of no use in that point at all — a plan is in agitation at present for a better,
                    which when it is completed will add much to the appearance of the Town, &amp; be

                <p>The Library is not very large but exceedingly neat, &amp; contains several very

                    so little is said to form any judgement — &amp; yet surely as they were supposed

                <p>As I barely mentioned having seen a bleaching ground near <placeName ref="pl0128">Aberdeen</placeName>, I cannot in justice pass on till I have given you
                    some better account of it. The spot chosen is some even vale, thro which a
                    stream of pure water runs naturally — sometimes a Canal is cut — at intervals
                    little Rivulets are made to branch from the large one, &amp; intersect the
                    ground into such portions as may suit the bleaching of different sorts of
                    Linnen, or perhaps different quantities. the ground is kept perfectly clean,
                    &amp; is of a most beautiful verdure — over the Canal in that of <placeName ref="pl0128">Aberdeen</placeName>, little Chinese Bridges were thrown, which
                    have a pleasing effect. a very considerable number of men, women, &amp;
                    Children, are employed in this work, who from their cleanliness, &amp; the
                    neatness of their appearance, seem quite of a different species. The women were
                    most of them drest in short white nightgowns, &amp; the men in short blue
                    Frocks. The Linnen during the day is all stretched out upon the grass, &amp; is
                    perpetually sprinkled from the rills that run near it by means of small scoops.
                    several thousand yards at once cover the plain &amp; the Industry of the people

                <p>Fascinated by the sound of a scraping Violin, &amp; the hopes of a dance we stopt
                    at a little petty Inn at <placeName ref="pl0328">Stonehive</placeName>; but
                    before we had finished the supper the dancing party had dispersed to our great,
                    &amp; heartfelt disappointment. We had still the satisfaction left to dance to a
                    bed which tho hard, was not uncomfortable, &amp; which had its charms to those
                    that had slept upon straw, or upon planks. We arose very early that we might go
                    two miles out of <add place="above">our</add> road, &amp; take a view of
                        <placeName ref="pl0329">Dunoter Castle</placeName> — a seat which belonged
                    to <persName ref="pe0129">Lord Marischall</persName>, &amp; was destroyed for
                    its noble master's being deeply concerned in the Rebellion of 1715. — The ruins
                    are situated upon a Rock of the plumb pudding kind, which projects into the sea,
                    &amp; which partly on this account &amp; partly on the height, &amp; steepness
                    of the Rock, are only accessible at one part. — At this place as a defence to
                    the Castle, was placed a very high stone wall, thro which a small passage,
                    easily defended, found its way into the Castle — before you arrived at the
                    interior parts of the Castle, you had several of these gates to pass. Within
                    side of the walls a vast number of other buildings in a most ruinous state were
                    contained, which must have been capable of tenanting a Regiment or two, of men,
                    or in days of yore of preserving in safety a very numerous Clan. The ruins of a
                    Chappel upon a small spot of sacred ground are very evident. Altho the rubbish
                    has half filled up most of a large range of vaults under the Castle, yet there
                    still remains one very intire. it bears the name of Whig's Vault because a great
                    number of the Covenanters were for a long time confined in it — many of whom are
                    said to have died there — others to avoid an Ignominy they had little merited,
                    jumped out of a small window if a mere hole to let in Light, might be called
                    such, &amp; perished in the Sea. It was but putting an end to a trouble far
                    worse than Death, to men, who, were assured of their Integrity, &amp; to whom
                    Hope denied every other Freedom. The Cave in which they were confined seems to
                    be merely excavated in the Rock, a strong artificial door was placed at the
                    mouth of it, which were it <pb n="f.62v"/><fw>115</fw> shut Art, &amp; Strength
                    could attempt in vain to open — thro a hole at the other end, you had merely a
                    view of the sea, which beating on the Rocks beneath formed a perpetual eccho in
                    this Cave — with this sound enter'd light, &amp; air, sufficient indeed to
                    discover their misery, &amp; to continue it — The cave itself was cold, &amp;
                    dreary, &amp; damp; &amp; the vapours which exhaled from it were of the most
                    fœtid, &amp; offensive nature — the poor miserables were allowed no seat on
                    which to rest themselves — they were starved dispirited, diseased. <persName ref="pe1398">Daniel</persName> would not have needed Lions in such a den, to
                    have tried his fidelity to his God — there was every thing what could cause the

                    feels the sense of another Interest in heaven, where "neither moth nor rust

                    immoveable, &amp; his fortitude divine, even in this vault ––––– perhaps I have
                    spoken with too much warmth — my nature seems to blush, &amp; say "Is there any
                    cause in which your mind could keep its peace in such confinement? Would your
                    Religion, &amp; your Virtue support you? — <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> felt the same &amp; our answer was mutual "We trust there
                    is such a cause — and we look for its support from God." –––––</p>
                <p>We return'd from the vault serious, &amp; ascended the wall which yet remain
                    standing — we walked on the top of the loftiest parts not without great fear,
                    altho little danger — we were told upon this highest place which is flat a
                    centinel used to sit all night, to watch the motions of an enemy, or merely as a
                    guard of the Gate, directly over which it is placed. There could be little
                    danger of his sleeping when the slightest Inattention might have been attended
                    with a trip of 80 Feet. There is said to be a communication under ground, to
                    every Room in the castle; this is probably fabulous, but there is a hole into
                    which no person ventures to trust himself, which is a sufficient ground for

                    Town of <placeName ref="pl0323">Montrose</placeName> 6500$ to build it. The
                    River was at this time very shallow, but from the depth, &amp; width of its
                    channel it must often be very deep, &amp; rapid. We arrived at <placeName ref="pl0323">Montrose</placeName> without meeting with one circumstance by
                    the way worth relating — There was one observation, which occurrred to us <add place="above">as</add> we past along that puzzled us. From what we could
                    collect the Rebellion in 1715 had been principally among the gentlemen of the
                    east Country, at least it is certain that most of the Castles on this coast were
                    destroyed at that time, whereas the Rebellion of 1745 raged principally to the
                    west, &amp; the north — we endeavoured to assign several Reasons which were
                    neither sufficient, nor satisfactory, &amp; I have therefore sent it home as a

                    Forts have been discover'd, which have had the walls of a <unclear reason="illegible">real</unclear> glassy nature, &amp; which as there is no

                    where all the stone near was of the plumb-pudding kind. Now it is likewise found

                    off, &amp; that a stratum of wood, &amp; that a stratum of these materials were

                    the air might rush. The wood was then kindled, &amp; the whole melted down. If

                    the reason for which appears to be the facility of communicating signals, &amp;

                    of stones laid one upon another, without any mortar. He supposes, &amp; who
                    shall contradict him? that therefore both these kind of Forts were built before
                    the introduction of Lime, which took place about the time that <placeName ref="pl1623">Rome</placeName> had establish'd its conquests in <placeName ref="pl0777">Britain</placeName>. He is in some measure strengthned in this

                    pleasing Melancholy prevails — the rays of the Soul are collected as it were to
                        <unclear reason="illegible">Forms</unclear> — it is clear, distinct,
                    consistent. But when the Darkness becomes excessive the Soul can no longer
                    attend to its own operations, it is anxious for the preservation of the body, it
                    fears, it trembles, it sinks. — <choice>

                    violent, degenerates into its contrary — anxiety becomes despair — the mind
                    loses all care for its own safety, &amp; cannot make the use of Circumstances
                    which might otherwise be highly advantageous. The antients in their petitions to

                <p>From what we had seen in our Tour, we had little reason to expect any thing which
                    would much alarm by its Novelty. Mountains above the clouds, rocky seas, rapid
                    Rivers, fertile vales, ruined abbies, Castles, palaces, were objects we had been
                    accustomed to — every common Reflection had been worn threadbare, &amp; the new
                    ones we flattered ourselves the first sensations had produced, had now shared
                    the same Fate. We had still however a novelty left which was to pass thro a day
                    without one single <add place="above">new</add> occurrence. It is true it rained
                    hard all they day, but that we had met with before — &amp; we were wet thro for
                    eight hours together, but that no claim to Novelty. The Country was neither rich
                    or poor, populous or desolate — there were attempts at Cultivation which seem
                    checked by Ignorance, or poverty, &amp; yet the progress considering every
                    difficulty seems to have been tolerable — it argued an attention, if not spirit,
                    a desire if not the power to improve. If as a Journalist I might ass over any
                    day in silence, it should be this — &amp; perhaps you would think it sufficient
                    if I were now to close this Letter a la mode de Logbook. "Wind. S.E. by E.

                    double the point of this Letter, &amp; say good night on the opposite side of
                    the sheet.</p>
                <p>As it was dark when we enterd <placeName ref="pl0094">Perth</placeName>, &amp;
                    raind when we set out, we certainly could not see the Town to advantage nor do I
                    think with the highest Sun, &amp; clearest Day that ever this Hemisphere
                    enjoyed, I should ever deem it a pleasing Town. it appears ill built, and the
                    houses are dirty, it is true the streets are pretty wide, which makes the houses
                    appear to much greater disadvantage The Language of the people at, &amp; near
                        <placeName ref="pl0094">Perth</placeName> is far more disagreable than any
                    we met with; the sounds deeply guttural, &amp; the whines, <pb n="f.67v"/><fw>125</fw> and half howling tones, majestically long — It was with the
                    greatest difficulty we could understand them, altho most of what they said in
                    any other mouths would have been merely bad english — We arrived at <placeName ref="pl0295">Crief</placeName> to Dinner. We had been informed the ride from
                        <placeName ref="pl0094">perth</placeName> to <placeName ref="pl0295">Crief</placeName> was thro a noble Country — it was scarcely tolerable
                    after seeing <placeName ref="pl0311">the Carse of Gowrie</placeName> — It is an
                    open Country, &amp; several Farm houses are seen at one view, but the corn was
                    mostly oats, &amp; thin — we saw a few furze hedges, which from their verdure
                    had a pleasing effect but <add place="above">when</add> we considerd them as
                    substitutes for wood, we felt that disagreable sensation which naturally arises
                    at the sight of poverty, &amp; barreness of Soil, or untoward severity of
                    Climate. —</p>
                <p>We did ourselves as well as we could <add place="above">at <placeName ref="pl0295">Crief</placeName>,</add> &amp; again set off in the rain
                    for <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>. As the road was good, &amp; we
                    could ride abreast we had not yet lost the power of entertaining one another,
                    nor the inclination — we sooth'd each others misfortunes, and at length bore a
                    wet shirt with all the philosophy of a <persName ref="pe2274">Zeno</persName>,
                    or a <persName ref="pe2249">Socrates</persName>. — O how we did from our hearts
                    laugh at those who must warm a pocket Handkerchief, or a Night Cap before they
                    make use of them — The smile however that we put on would not have been taken by
                    any person in tolerable ease, for a smile of Triumph — our Faces were stiffned
                    by the wind, &amp; Rain, &amp; were not strictly subservient to the motions of
                    the will but our feelings, &amp; our hearts were as free &amp; as sound as ever.

                    cold, &amp; hungry — but other great men had endured the same without the
                    advantage which we met with, of a monstrous large Fire, a good Supper, &amp; a
                    comfortable bed — we made the best use of all three, &amp; slept a long
                    refreshing night without one Dream either to comfort, or discompose us — May
                    every forlorn Traveller meet with equal consolation. Adieu. –––––</p>

                    <fw>126</fw> We had now strictly speaking completed our Tour — and had nothing
                    to do but to pursue a different Road home, than that in which we had set out. We
                    passed on the opposite side of <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName>,
                    thro <placeName ref="pl0236">Falkirk</placeName> &amp;c to <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName>. and the things which we saw, &amp; which
                    we heard are they not written beneath for the entertainment of those who enjoy
                    Novelty, or delight in wars — who sacrifice their feelings to their Curiosity,
                    or to their Country? –––––</p>
                <p>The Country between <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>, &amp;
                        <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName> is in general cultivated, but
                    the crops are thin, &amp; poor — indeed the view of <placeName ref="pl0311">the
                        Carse of Gowrie</placeName> dwelt yet strong in our memories, &amp; ruled
                    every sense. At any other time I should probably have praised this Country as
                    exceeding rich, &amp; especially after our ride from <placeName ref="pl1248">Killechranan</placeName>, to <placeName ref="pl3216">Kilmure</placeName>.
                    At present I do not think it deserves one sentence, at all tinctured with
                    praise. The Harvest was by no means so forward here as we had lately met with
                    it; we saw several Fields of Barley that were quite green. The Country on this
                    South side of <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName> may be called low
                    for a considerable extent; — there are, it is true, a few eminences but which in
                    general admit of Corn upon them, or from their natural verdure add much to the
                    view. That Land which in <placeName ref="pl0775">England</placeName> we call
                    Meadow, &amp; deem best for Hay, is here for the most part sown with Grain,
                    &amp; produces the richest Crops. As we rode along upon elevated ground about 6
                    miles distance from <placeName ref="pl0083">the Firth</placeName> we had at
                    intervals a noble view of numerous Towns upon its Shores &amp; a great number of
                    vessels that were passing &amp; repassing. on the opposite shore there is a
                    range of mountains on the Tops of many of which the clouds rested or moved round
                    with a kind of Sullen motion. These &amp; the appearances of the Clouds above us
                    threatened Rain the first Hours ride, but fortunately <persName ref="pe2275">phæton</persName> assisted by <persName ref="pe2276">Eolus</persName>
                    prevailed, &amp; sent the firstborn of <persName ref="pe2277">Neptune</persName>
                    on hasty wing to distant shores to bless other lands, &amp; render other
                    travellers uncomfortable –––––</p>
                <p><pb n="f.68v"/>
                    <fw>127</fw> We arrived about 9 at <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName>,
                    &amp; breakfasted — Would, my dear <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName> it
                    were possible to give you any description of the vast works which are carried on
                    here, at all adequate to what we saw &amp; head — it would then fill you with
                    astonishment, &amp; Horror as it did us — &amp; yet the weakness of my memory,
                    &amp; my pen may be deem'd fortunate for you — your mind cannot be tranquil but
                    it will not be terrified — the calm may yet be ruffled, but the gale will soon
                    pass over it &amp; leave it to its former peace &amp; quiet. —</p>
                <p>We were at some distance apprized of our approach to <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName> by a disagreable sulphurous smell, &amp; the sight of
                    vast vollies of Smoke slowly ascending &amp; streak'd with livid flames. Every
                    person we met seem'd to have some congruity with the place — they were dark,
                    gloomy, surly &amp; if I had it in my power to embody, &amp; imbricate some of
                    our worst passions <add place="above">&amp; set them in the most detestable
                        light</add> for the benefit of mankind I would select the forms from
                        <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName>. They could not strictly be said
                    to be inhabitants of Earth, unless those are called so who breathe sulphurous
                    vapours — whose residence is by day<del rend="overstrike">rk</del> in darkness
                    ill illum'd, &amp; by night with surrounding Flames, hoarse murmuring as they
                    ascend — <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName> is certainly one of the
                    noblest, &amp; most sublime works of art. It puts one quite into conceit with
                        <del rend="overstrike">my</del>on<add place="above">e</add>self, as it shows
                    upon the largest scale the Invention, &amp; the power of man. It is almost
                    impossible to conceive how much an assemblage of Machines, calculated for the
                    greatest variety of purposes, &amp; of bulk, &amp; weight the most immense,
                    could be so placed, &amp; preserved as to execute their great offices with ease,
                    &amp; facility — &amp; yet to reflect upon all this noble workmanship being much
                    more for the destruction, than the advantage of mankind, palls the satisfaction
                    it is otherwise fitted to give, &amp; you detest that ambition which has led
                    modern Heroes to inventions, replete with devastation, &amp; death. –––––</p>
                <p>You are not permitted to enter the walls without permission of one of the
                    Directors which I am told is never refused — your name &amp; place of abode is
                    formally required, &amp; a man attends you the thro all the works. We were first
                    conducted to see the stores of boilers, pots, &amp; cauldrons of an immense
                    size, all of cast Iron. We were then led to see a vast variety of Bath Stoves,
                    &amp;c things of great utility, &amp; Elegance which are very numerous, &amp;
                    laid in the most regular order. <pb n="f.69r"/>
                    <fw>128</fw> We were informed that a great number of these are sent to
                        <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName>, many more abroad, which latter
                    trade hath much declined since the War began. We passed thro four large
                    storehouses of these conveniences of Life, in which we met with several new
                    patterns &amp; ingenious contrivances. All this was very pleasing, the
                    advantages were obvious. —</p>
                <p>You are next Conducted to view the stores of Ball, Grape shot, canister shot
                    &amp;c which are so numerous &amp; well arranged, &amp; of so many horrid forms,
                    that you insensibly withdraw shuddering from a sight so pregnant with future Woe
                    — we could at distance see the Widow, the Fatherless, &amp; the kind parent
                    deploring the cruel fate of those who were dearest to them — our Imaginations
                    painted to us the wounds &amp; the groans of the dying — yet dark as this scene
                    was a blushing dawn seem'd to arise when we thought of Liberty, a reality,
                    without which Life is not worth enjoying — What they call Canister Shot are a
                    great number of Balls, or pieces of Nails &amp;c, fastned slightly in a thin
                    plate of Iron, &amp; which immediately breaks either when discharged from a
                    Cannon, or the first thing it strikes against — These are another kind of Shot
                    composed of eight short bars of Iron fitted &amp; slightly tied together which
                    upon being discharged seperates as the above. These are of different forms,
                    &amp; are said now to be much in use for cutting the Rigging of Vessels — The
                    most shocking of all is that to which they gave the name of Star shot. It
                    consists of eight pieces of Iron adapted to each other, fastened at one end with
                    a strong single, &amp; having knots at the other, slightly connected by a fillet
                    of thin Iron — each of these pieces is about 12 or 14 Inches long — The knots
                    are closed, &amp; first put into the Cannon — as soon as they are discharged
                    they seperate, yet held by the single, they whizz along, &amp; I should thing
                    could rarely fail of doing execution. We are told that they are now coming into
                    Fashion &amp; are charitably supposed to be used merely for destroying the
                    Rigging — the French may politely design no more — but the english are
                    barbarians.</p>
                <p>––––– We saw some balls of 68 lb each, which were made for some Carronades lately
                    cast here — it is said a few of these are at present in the Navy, as they are
                    not near so long as the Cannon formerly in use, their weight is not very great —
                    We were next shown pieces of Cannon of all sizes. The request for these articles
                    has been of late much greater than formerly. It is certain a considerable part

                    <add place="inline">is</add> supplied from the Foundry at <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName>. We were informed from <pb n="f.69v"/><fw>129</fw> the best authority, that the Dutch have within this last
                    half-year purchased, &amp; taken away more than an 100 pieces of Cannon, with
                    provender for each — How far it is for the Interest of Government to permit such
                    a Traffic during wars is not for me to say — but my Father to whom I refer this
                    will readily acquaint you. More than 9000 pieces of Cannon of different sizes
                    have been cast within the last 5 years, most of which are disposed of, as they
                    are cheap &amp; being light, are managed with fewer men — Government has a great
                    many of them but they are mostly made use of by privateers. The man told us they
                    had lately received a large order from the admiralty board. We examined several
                    pieces closely — they are much shorter than the Cannon generally used, &amp;
                    they are said to be getting into discredit on this account for it is attested
                    that they neither carry balls to so great a distance, nor do they hit with so
                    great <del rend="overstrike">a</del> certainty, as the longer ones. we did not
                    receive this information within the works, altho we in vain endeavour'd to get
                    it confirmed. —</p>
                <p>We were fortunate to see some 32 lb balls cast. The Iron is first melted, &amp;
                    then pour'd into moulds a composition of Sand &amp; Clay — when the ball is cool
                    it is taken out &amp; finished up — We here saw a large Cauldron of liquid Iron,
                    of the most intense white heat: we approached near it, &amp; could clearly see
                    it boiling, We were told that this Furnace needs some regulation once a day
                    which requires a man to go into it — it is cooled as much as it can be, but yet
                    the poor fellow must enter it insufferably hot for 13<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> a week, most of which money <add place="above">he</add> is obliged
                    to expend in Liquor to keep any fluids at all in his body. The fellow came up to
                    us, &amp; told his story with a smile of satisfaction that surpized us — he
                    seem'd sensible of the Injury he was doing himself, but it appears a standing
                    topic of pride with him, &amp; like his betters he had rather sacrifice his Life
                    than his glory. His visage, &amp; appearance is that of a skeleton — his eyes
                    are sunk, his voice hollow, &amp; in singing his tale of Triumph "he grinn'd
                    horrible many a ghastly smile."<note type="editorial">A reference to Milton's
                        description of death in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, Book II,
                        l.846.</note> He is very near dried up, &amp; I think it is not difficult to
                    foretell his Fate — the heat will certainly one day catch him like Tinder, or
                    touch paper, &amp; crackling he will disappear.</p>
                <p><pb n="f.70r"/>
                    <fw>130</fw> We afterwards walked into another office, &amp; saw several moulds
                    in which Cannon are cast — We were here likewise singularly fortunate, in seeing
                    a six pounder run. The mould is placed perpendicular in sand with the mouth just
                    appearing above the surface, &amp; at about three yards distance from the
                    Cauldron. A groove is then made in the Sand which leads to it, into which liquid
                    Iron is pour'd, runs along and fills up the mould. it was filled up in two
                    minutes. We stood as near the operation as we dare, &amp; bold as we were we did
                    not feel ourselves altogether free of Anxiety, &amp; dread. All the Cannon are
                    at first cast solid, &amp; the bore is afterwards made by means of a water
                    engine; which last operation no person is permitted to see. A twenty four
                    pounder is said to be done in 10 or 12 hours. This boring hath not been long in
                    practice — it was formerly the custom to cast them hollow —, by which means they
                    not infrequently burst in the proving — this is said now to be very rarely the
                    case.</p>
                <p>We were next taken to see the bellows which kindle, &amp; support those wondrous
                    Fires we had seen — two or three gentlemen who were viewing the works with us,
                    refused to follow us — it was truly dark, &amp; dreadful, &amp; not so dangerous
                    but any one who had the spirit of a man, would take his chance for a peep. I am
                    sure, <persName ref="pe1559">Miss P.</persName>, had you been there I should
                    have the pleasure of conducting you wherever I chose to go myself, or the ardent
                    zeal of <persName ref="pe2190">Lister</persName> led me, &amp; you would have
                    been amply repaid. We blushed for the gentlemen, &amp; followed our guide up a
                    dark entry, over bits of old Iron, &amp; Cannon ball, &amp; soon arrived at the
                    bellows, the noise of which prevented our hearing each other speak when near
                    them.</p>
                <p>––––– Four large Cylinders of cast iron about 12 Feet high, &amp; 30 Inches
                    Diameter were placed perpendicular, into which were fitted four pistons of an
                    immense weight, &amp; pressure —of which two were alternately going up, while
                    the other two were sinking upon the air admitted with all their wight, so that
                    two of the Cylinders are filled with air while the other two are discharging.
                    This vast body of air is thus driven with the greatest violence thro a tube only
                    two Inches, &amp; a half in diameter, into the Furnace, with a noise that nearly
                    stuns you. The appearance of the Fire at the point of the Tube is of the most
                    dazzling white, &amp; to fix the eye but a moment upon it pains <del rend="overstrike">the eye</del>
                    <add place="above">it</add> for a considerable time. The piston is so nicely
                    adapted to the Cylinder that it worked with as much ease at that of a pump. —
                        <pb n="f.70v"/><fw>131</fw> The whole of this process is set in motion by
                    water, which works it not unlike a mill. Sure there never was a nobler
                    assemblage of the elements bought about by human art, or Industry — Water Air
                    &amp; Fire, combined to melt the hardest part of Earth, &amp; perform<del rend="overstrike">ing</del> it with a majesty &amp; ease that confounds —
                        <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> you at once tremble &amp; admire. —</p>
                <p>There are five pair of bellows like those which I have attempted to give some
                    Idea of. We afterwards saw them separating the metal from the Iron, which they
                    bring from the neighboring mountains. The Quantity of Scoriæ that runs out is
                    astonishing, &amp; looks like a glassy Lava from a little volcanoe — We then
                    past thro other Offices where they were forming less things, with much poorer
                    fires — or re-smelting, &amp; purifying the Ore. — A little to the back part of
                    these offices are several furnaces in the ground, in which the coals, Lime
                    &amp;c are blended that serve as fuel for the greater Fires — The smoke ascends
                    from these in clouds, often streaked with fire. — We were afterwards taken to
                    see the Engine by which the water is raised for working the great bellows, &amp;
                    performing other offices. it is worked by Steam, &amp; is an immense production
                    of Art. I wished it had been in my power to have obtained as good an account of
                    this as we desired, but our guide could give us little information, &amp; we had
                    not time to make any satisfactory observations ourselves. A vast bason of Water
                    for all these purposes has been formed near these works, &amp; is regulated by
                    sluices from a neighbouring canal, which itself has not been long cut, &amp;
                    joins <placeName ref="pl0083">the Forth</placeName> with <placeName ref="pl0600">the Clyde</placeName>. —</p>
                <p>The Carron Company is said to employ not less than 1200 men at these works. 400
                    of whom are constantly employed within the walls, &amp; the rest in collecting
                    coal, iron stone &amp;c the appearance of those within are truly diabolic, most
                    of them half naked, &amp; as black as the region that they live in — they are
                    said not to be very long lived — this is little to be wonder'd at, as most of
                    them seem half parched. The Country around <placeName ref="pl0237">Carron</placeName> is populous — but women &amp; children, houses, &amp;
                    fields, have the same unnatural smoky appearance. There are always two or three
                    directors upon the spot to conduct the works — their houses are tolerable, &amp;
                    placed at as great a distance as convenience will admit. –––––</p>

                    <fw>132</fw> We afterwards passed thro <placeName ref="pl0236">Falkirk</placeName>, a neat country town. It was about two miles to the
                    west of this Town, that the Rebels defeated a party of the Kings Dragoons in
                        1745<note type="editorial">A reference to the Jacobite victory at Falkirk in
                        1746. The government forces included a complement of dragoons.</note> — we
                    were pointed to the spot at a distance but as there was nothing worthy
                    observation, &amp; it was intirely out of the Road we were content to pass on.
                    The Country around may perhaps be cultivated as well as the soil will admit, but
                    it has a very poor appearance. Indeed after seeing <placeName ref="pl0311">the
                        Carse of Gowrie</placeName>, not <placeName ref="pl2111">Sicily</placeName>,

                    have raised any new sensation — We dined at <placeName ref="pl0383">Linlithgow</placeName> 17 miles from <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName>. we took a view of <placeName ref="pl2497">the
                        Castle</placeName> which is a lofty structure, &amp; well situated. from the
                    style in which it is built it cannot be very antient — it is now in ruins. there
                    appears scarce to have been one large Room in the house. It was a kind of half
                    way house to <placeName ref="pl0235">Stirling</placeName>, &amp; a hunting seat
                    of the James's –––––</p>
                <p>All the money we could muster at <placeName ref="pl0383">Linlithgow</placeName>
                    was half a guinea, &amp; three shillings — the bill was 3<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>6, &amp; the half guinea, refused as light — we could not pay the
                    other <hi rend="superscript">d</hi>6/ nor give anything to the hostler or waiter
                    — we made what defence we could, but still retreated with disgrace — we had four
                    Turnpikes to pass thro, &amp; not a farthing to pay if our half guinea was bad —
                    When we came within sight of the first, a council of war was held in which it
                        <add place="above">was</add> resolved nem: con: 1. To offer the Kings coin
                    however abused. 2 That while one was doing this the other should sneak thro the

                    if it did not succeed, we were to ride <del rend="overstrike">to</del> on as
                    hard as we could — upon these resolutions we elevated ourselves on the stirrups,
                    &amp; advanced firmly to the Gate — the half guinea was accepted, &amp; our
                    resolutions like many other which cautious people form in their distress,
                    dissolved in smoke — we went home rich.</p>
                <p>We arrived about 9 in the Evening at <placeName ref="pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName> in safety health &amp; Spirits — We sat, &amp; drank
                    our Tea in Tranquillity, and departed from each other with that kind of
                    pleasure, &amp; satisfaction, which arises from becoming better acquainted with
