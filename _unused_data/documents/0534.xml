                    he informs me that there are a number of similar Orders of the same nature
                    against them, when the Argyle Family, who appear to have been their great
                    Enemies having always been present &amp; most frequently the principal

                    rivalship, Family private feuds it is now very difficult to account for there
                    being such a mixture of traditional stories handed down that the truth is

                    conclusion or reflection on either side. ––––– I should think it is scarcely
                    worth your notice to be further concerned about this private Family Quarrel, for
                    it's probable by too minutely dipping into this personal difference some
                    Families may be brought in that <add place="above">would</add> not be so very
                    agreable at this day to them, but if what has already been sent does not so
                    fully satisfy you I shall endeavour to get as particular Extracts as can be had
                    from the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0192">Register</title></bibl>, As the Acts of Council are many since the period mentioned
                    above &amp; all in the similar stile with the intended design of rooting out the
                    Clan Gregor or MacGregor.</p>
