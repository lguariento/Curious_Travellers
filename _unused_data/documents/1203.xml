                    He has by my impertinence done a few drawings for you: but he wishes now to stop till he knows, it is quite agreable to you. I am sorry to trouble on the subject. Indeed it is a little trouble to myself; for my spirits are far from good. all things go on well with me but the loss of

                    we daily look out for the blessing of peace;<note type="editorial">Peace talks between Great Britain and France were held in the summer of 1797. As early as August difficulties were arising because of the French Government’s insistence on the return of its own captured colonies and those of its allies, Spain and the Batavian Republic. By the end of September the talks were in a state of deadlock, and they were abandoned in October. S.
