                <opener><note type="editorial">Details about David Pennant suggest the beginnings of his first continental tour, which involved travel in Swizterland (vs Madrid, Alicante in 1788, second tour; not sure about third, but Pennant mentions to Allen David's wish to visit the North, which I suspect may mean Russia)
                    Consider relationship with no. 46: mention of Holbein in a marginal note by Bull; David setting out in August. This a July / August 1785 date; Cordiner not a problem, and Mazell's address (no. 41 Drury lane) seems consistent with other evidence in these letters</note>

                    yet is rather cheaper in his prices. two of his drawings are very fine – one is of <rs type="art" ref="ar0129"><placeName ref="pl1017">Lichfield</placeName> cathedral</rs>

                <p>I received yesterday the second part of <persName ref="pe0401">Holbein</persName>'s works for which accept my best thanks.<note type="editorial">See <ref target="1034.xml">1034</ref>.</note> They are extremely elegantly done,
