                <p>I am happy to hear from you from any quarter of the Globe; but am made more happy to find that you have the satisfaction of finding that your situation has so well 
                    an<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="2" reason="illegible"/></del>swered the purpose. I have thoughts of visiting 
                    <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName> before this winter is past; perhaps next month &amp; shall be much mortified not to meet with you there. have not you 
                    &amp; to be regular amindst the temptations of an irregular age? It is surely worthy the tryal especially when health is to be

                <p>A Letter of mine was probably in <placeName ref="pl0758">stratton-street</placeName> when yours reached me. I must refer to that for an account of

                    I w<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>ish I could flatter you with the hopes of having a volume in any reasonable time, but other work crosses us 
                    &amp; occasions delays.

See <ref target="1044.xml">1044</ref> and <ref target="1047.xml">1047</ref>, in the latter of which it becomes apparent that the works were copies of works of Holbein's by a contemporary artist, based at Basle.</note>
                    but it is really unnecessary. The hard weather has left us in the gentlest manner &amp; as grain is reasonable,
