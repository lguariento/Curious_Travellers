                <p>I am rather astonished that I should never think of a great paper copy of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0272">my new London</title></bibl>
                    till you rubbed up my memory. Be so good as to trouble yourself with executing the inclosed commission: &amp;
                    by way of brokerage accept one copy, &amp; keep the other till we meet. It is my intention to keep <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0271">my second Edition</title></bibl>.
                    multitudes of heads &amp; views are already pasted in the margins. Those are immoveable: but I shall <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>
                    translate the greater heads, &amp; prints into the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0272">newest edition</title></bibl>:
                    Two leaves in the middle of each <del>volume</del><add place="above">Edition</add> must be cancell’d to divide the book which will 
                    be otherwise too large by itself. This may be done when we meet. otherwise I will cut out &amp; send you the leaves. I shall be in

                    every friend I have is gone who w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> give me a social evening.</p>
                <p>
                    I am much affected with the accounts you give of the french loyalists. their case is deplorable.<note type="editorial">This is a reference to the French Royalist émigrés and their plight, to which Bull gives some attention in his letter of 25 January 1793 (<ref target="1162.xml">1162</ref>).</note>
                    The relations really shake my nerves: as to the poor <persName ref="pe0824">King</persName>, his end was heroic, &amp;
                    he died a martyr to savage fury: &amp; as innocent as you or I. As to <persName ref="pe0418">Egalité</persName> he will very soon want a place to lay his head. 
                    I wonder at y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> dislike to our new ally <persName ref="pe0894">Kath: of Russia</persName>: 
                    for to deal with monsters, what can you select more proper than a monster. But the cause really disturbs my quiet. I resume the quil 
                    very unintentionally, merely to drive away the horrible thoughts of murders &amp; every kind of social distress.</p>
                <p>
                    I am very sorry for any particular uneasiness you may have felt: but sincerely hope for its speedy removal.</p>
