                <p>I am going to scribble a few hasty lines to you, not because I have any thing particular to say, but because I have a Franker at my elbow, and I wish to thank you, with my whole heart, for your last kind remembrance of me, and my poor 
                    <persName ref="pe0331">Girl</persName>. I have the comfort of thinking her rather better both in body, and mind, owing perhaps to the society of her incomparable friend 
                    <persName ref="pe0382">Lady Clarges</persName>, who knows equally well how to be gay with the giddy, and grave with the sedate. I was pleased to hear you had directed 
                    <persName ref="pe0324">Ingleby</persName> to make me a drawing of the <rs type="art" ref="ar0346">old Hall at Mostyn</rs>, the <hi rend="underline">inside</hi> of it I hope.
                    I wish he would also do me the Elevation of the front of <rs type="art" ref="ar0382">Lord Dungannon’s house</rs>, and the <rs type="art" ref="ar0383">old Mansion of the Trevor family</rs>,
                    both which I saw in poor <persName ref="pe0379">Chiswell</persName>'s books, by the hand of <persName ref="pe0324">Ingleby</persName>.
                    I would have them upon the same thin paper, and <add place="above">of</add> the same <del>thin paper</del> dimensions as the other Drawings he has now in hand for me, and if he can make me a small drawing of 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0350"><hi rend="underline">the wheat Ear Bird</hi></rs>. I should be glad; <persName ref="pe0014">Moses Grifyth</persName>
                    did one for me, upon a former occasion, and perhaps will permit <persName ref="pe0324">Ingleby</persName> to copy it. <persName ref="pe0014">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Grifyth</persName>
                    has my title page to the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0023">large paper arctick Zoology</title></bibl>, and the <del>Index</del><add place="above">List</add>
                    of the birds for want of which, I cannot bind up my Volumes. I wrote about this little business once or twice, and will request you to ask him about them, when you have an opportunity. I don’t speak from my memory, but from an entry in my memorandum book. 
                    <persName ref="pe0379">chiswell</persName> had also a <rs type="art" ref="ar0351">drawing of Sir Richard Trevor</rs>, whose portrait I wish to have, and also the view of a singular cliff, being 
                    n<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 136 of <persName ref="pe0324">Ingleby</persName>'s Catalogue.<note type="editorial">This may refer to 'Craig <sic>Eyri<del>gi</del>r</sic> or Rock of the Eagles', included at vol. 2, 138 (rather than 136 as noted by Bull here), in what appears to be a list of drawing by John Ingleby relating to Pennant's <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales</hi>. NLW 9674D. Note that this manuscript contains three unnumbered lists, one of which is headed by a note in Pennant's hand stating that 'Description's in red or Red figures are such as Ingleby has shewn me &amp; are the numbers on his sketches'.</note></p>
                <p>
                    I have neither time just now, or indeed inclination to go over the large and Interesting field of Politic’s with you, but I hope and trust, that men of all parties, and of all denominations, will 
                    <hi rend="underline">now be convinc’d</hi> that no peace can be made with the Savages of <placeName ref="pl0925">France</placeName>; Delenda est Carthago,<note type="editorial">'Carthage must be destroyed'. The phrase was popular among senators of the Roman Republic during the second century BC, and referred to their aspiration to quash Rome's most persistent rival, the Phoenician city-state of Carthage.</note>
                    applied to <placeName ref="pl0777">great Britain</placeName>, has been the Plan of every succeeding faction, and it is their intention to shake to the foundation this happy Constitution of ours, as far as they have the power of doing it. nothing but unanimity and Energy on our parts can prevent it, and we must all retrench in our usual Expenses, in order to furnish the means of carrying on the war, – more vigorously than we have done. 
                    <persName ref="pe0331">Miss Bull</persName> desires me not to omit her best thanks for being so much and so often in your recollection, and we both join in all manner of good wishes to the whole 
                    House of Pennant.</p>
