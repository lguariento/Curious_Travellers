                        have been around fifteen years old at this time.</note> <gap reason="authorial" unit="letters" quantity="several"/> I send the

                    by Pennant in <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales</hi>. The Beaumaris inscriptions may be those on a stone on the south side of the altar of the church, which are given 
                    in <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi> (1778), II, p. 247.</note> – The Fish, I mention’d that I intended a visit to, was 
                    a trick put upon me by a waggish acquaintance, who deem’d it the most effectual method of enticing me so far from home to partake of a 
                    drinking match. –</p>

                zoology</hi>. The 'Poor' is the only one illustrated by Moses Griffith. See <hi rend="italic">British zoology</hi> (2nd edn., 1768–70), III, Plate IX, facing p. 150.</note> which I sent, was brought me lately, which I thought it unnecessary to preserve,
