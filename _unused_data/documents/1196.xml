                <p>This 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of December I may tell you that <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> has not completed 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0034">our Whiteford</title></bibl>: all the drawings I thought worthy of a place, are sketch &amp;
                    shaded, I hope he will not be much longer, but like a <sic>true catches</sic> at every offered Job &amp; neglects what he has had long in hand.</p>
                <p>
                    I hope you passed the late summer pleasantly. If you went the way I suspect, I might be of use on the road, Especially had I furnished you with the complete list of the portraits of my 
                    <del>jour</del> inedited <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="4" reason="illegible"/></del>journals which I <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>extracted, a most horrid dull 
                    &amp; painful work at the request of <persName ref="pe0415">Sir W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Musgrave</persName> which nothing should tempt me to again</p>
                <p>
                    The late summer has been to me a wretched one. The dissensions that reigned &amp; still reign in our unhappy little country affected me with the Asthma which I have not yet got free from. 
                    It is singular that the disorder of the mind should affect the body with such a disorder: but it has arrived at such a <sic>heighn</sic> as to make the calling in of a physician <sic>requite</sic>.
                    You may have seen in the papers that my nephew <persName ref="pe0414">Sir Th. Mostyn</persName> has by the rascality of a fasion been elected under age. a petition will be preferred, 
                    &amp; probably driven from his a proper lesson to a youth for listening to bad advisers &amp; neglecting the guardians appointed by his <persName ref="pe0015">parent</persName>.
                    The resolution of the house will be novel. non age elections may pass in small boroughs: but the insult ought never to be suffered in counties. Pray inform me how <persName ref="pe0331">miss Bull</persName>
                    &amp; you do. You have my earnest wishes for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> welfare. my <persName ref="pe0421">younger boy</persName>
                    I had with me all the summe He was attacked at School with a severe cough and an uncommon growth.<note type="editorial">Thomas Pennant, junior, was presumably still at school in <placeName ref="pl2031">Hackney</placeName>. See <ref target="1163.xml">1163</ref>.</note> we took him down with us after we had the pleasure of seeing you. By air 
                    &amp; exercise he is perfectly restored. I <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="3" reason="illegible"/></del> engaged an ingenious young clergyman.<note type="editorial">This may refer to <persName ref="pe1781">Griffith Lloyd</persName>.</note>
                    His application to learning a morning &amp; night is amazing &amp; his amusement at midday with his gun is not less so. I have the fairest hopes of him.</p>
