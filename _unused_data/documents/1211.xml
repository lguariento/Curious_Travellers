                <p>In return for your very entertaining favor of December 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I have the pleasure of saying that I can send you comfortable news respecting your imaginary losses. In the first place the title pages, dedication &amp; fore pages of the Preface to the 
                    <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0690">Introduction to the the arctic Z:</title></bibl> have been found.</p>
                <p>
                    In respect to the title pages to the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0023">arctic zoology</title></bibl> with the <rs type="art" ref="ar0354">Elks head</rs> &amp; &amp; the pied duck &amp; the direction,<note type="editorial">For the title pages to 
                        the <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi> which Bull claimed he was missing, see his letter to Pennant, 
                        <ref target="1210.xml">1210</ref>. Pennant writes of the 'direction' in answer to Bull's queries regarding 'directions for placing the plates 
                        of vol: I.' and 'the directions for placing the plates of VOL. II.'. This suggests that Bull was working on extra-illustrating the 
                        second edition, where the directions appear at the beginning of each volume (rather than the first edition, which amalgamates 
                        these directions in vol. I). Note that Hughs, named as the person able to reprint both title pages and direction for placing the 
                        plates, was the printer of the first, not the second, edition, however.</note>
                    if I cannot find them, they can be readily replaced by reprinting the pages. which I shall give directions about to <persName ref="pe0111">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughs</persName>.
                    As to the supposed mistake in the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0034">history of Whiteford</title></bibl> page 173 to 184 it is of no sort of importance for there is no omission between them, a mistake of the printerâ€™s which I found out long ago. The<del>se</del>
                    losses shall be supplied in the first parcel <persName ref="pe0324">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingleby</persName> sends: but the two title pages with Elks head that: must be done in 
                    <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName> under your directions conveyd thro y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> humble servant. This business has stirred me up to complete the illumination of my 
                    <del>arctic</del> copy of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0023">arctic Zoology</title></bibl>, towards which I find I have a rich hoard which I had not seeen for years past.</p>
                <p>
                    I rejoice at y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> happy change of health. long may you enjoy it. The horrid wet which reigns here affects my stomach &amp; certainly lessens the benefit of the <placeName ref="pl0796">Bath</placeName> waters.</p>
                <p>
                    The same unanimity is found in this country as in other places. The taxes will bear hard especially on a certain class which includes the vain, who have been exerting every nerve to ape their betters by imprudent <gap unit="letters" quantity="several" reason="illegible"/> emulation.</p>
                <p>
                    The best wishes of this house attend <persName ref="pe0331">miss Bull</persName> &amp; yourself.</p>
