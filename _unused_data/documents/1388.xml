                <p>It is some comfort to say that my dear <persName ref="pe0235">child</persName> recovers strength:<note type="editorial">Pennant's younger 
                    daughter, Sarah, suffered from frequent bouts of illness, probably tuberculosis, from October 1792. She died on 16 April 1794. See Evans, 
                    'The Life and Work of Thomas Pennant (1726–1798)', pp. 73–4.</note> &amp; we do flatter ourselves 
                    that when her health is restored the other blessing may by added, The rest of us are well: my <persName ref="pe0237">sister</persName>
                    excepted, who has suffered a great deal for some time past. I lament that I must be separated from my natural friends for a longer time 
                    than I intended. our Physician has ordered <persName ref="pe0235">Sarah</persName> to some sea bathing place as soon as possible: 
                    so we shall go, I believe to one of those on <add place="above">the</add> coast of <placeName ref="pl1336">Kent</placeName>. 
                    this will retard our return till midsummer at <sic>lest</sic>.

                <p>I hope this will find you &amp; y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> family well. I shall be glad to hear they are so. &amp; also all the news of
