                <p>Various occupations engaged me for some time after my return: otherwise I should not have failed to make enquiry after you 
                    &amp; yours. I trust this will find you all better than when I left you. you must never give way to dejection but let us enjoy ourselves as long as we can by every innocent amusement. I drive off the evil spirit by writing 
                    &amp; now my pen works with the vigour of thirty. I fling down that I use for the siege of <placeName ref="pl1498">Boulogne</placeName> &amp; the history of its smugl<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="3" reason="illegible"/></del>ers
                    &amp;c &amp;c<note type="editorial">The first siege of Boulogne took place in 1544, during the third invasion of France by Henry VIII. A second siege followed during the Italian War of 1542–6. 
                        Pennant's interest in these events relates to work on <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0266">'Outlines of the Globe': VI and VII</title></bibl>.</note> to catch up that dedicated to my friend <persName ref="pe0313">Bull</persName>; &amp; 
                    it now tells you to write a speedy account of y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> health and that of miss Bulls.<note xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" type="editorial"><xi:include href="Bulls.xml"/></note>
                    If their rheumatisms plague them, away to <placeName ref="pl0008">Buxton</placeName> which may bring them so far on their road to 
                    <placeName ref="pl0731">Wales</placeName>, &amp; give us a chance of seeing you. Pray do not forget the state of the 
                    new river: among other particulars, I wish to know how many houses it has for tenants; &amp; what parts of the town it supplies.<note type="editorial">For Pennant's interest in the 'new river' and, in later letters, in the New River Company, see <hi rend="italic">Of London</hi> (1790), pp. 196–8.</note>
                    But other news not relative to my labors will be very acceptable.</p>
                <p>I am just on the point of going to Thanksgive:<note type="editorial">23 April 1789 was a day of thanksgiving for the return to health of George III.</note>
                    &amp; then treat my numerous miners &amp; colliers with Beef &amp; ale; illuminations &amp; transparencies: so that the rogues will think Loyalty a good thing &amp; 
                    roar out ‘<hi rend="underline">Cot pless Kink Shorge</hi>' till they cease to articulate. The truth is I alway 
                    give annual treats, only on this occasion add a little more. I must own I fear the event of this day; &amp; 
                    tremble for the effect it may have on the head of majesty. If it stands the huzzas of his good subjects, I think we may ensure it the rest of his days. </p>
