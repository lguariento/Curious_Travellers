                <p>On Friday last I returned here from <placeName ref="pl3322">Beechwood</placeName> where I received the most friendly and the 
                    most obliging Reception. I took an Opportunity to examine all the M.S.S. more leisurely than before, but found nothing to your
                    present Purpose; what now remains, relates almost all together to 
                    <placeName ref="pl1245">Southwales</placeName>.<note type="editorial">Pennant's interest in south Wales appears to have waned following
                    his abandonment of a journey there during summer 1776. See his correspondence with John Price, dated 8 September 1776 
                    (<ref target="1488.xml">1488</ref>); and cf. also his 
                    avowal that he is uninterested
                    in the south in a letter to Richard Bull during 1784 (<ref target="1037.xml">1037</ref>).</note> There is one Volume 
                    in f<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. almost full of Drawings, of Monuments, Antiquities, Inscriptions &amp;<unclear>a</unclear>. in that Part of the
                    Principality. In some of <persName ref="pe0044">Lhwyd</persName>'s Pocket Books I found <sic>ā</sic> Account of his Travels in Ireland
                    and Scotland, written almost entirely in Welsh, but I had not sufficient Leisure to compare them to satisfy myself that they are a 
                    complete Journal.<note type="editorial">Pennant thanks Sir John Sebright for 'his liberal communication of several of the late Mr. EDWARD
                    LLWYD's Manuscripts' in the 'Advertisement' to <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi> (2nd edn., 1784), II, p. ii, and evidence 
                        of his consultation of them is noted in footnotes throughout both volumes of the tour.</note> I had been given to understand that Lhwyd's MS.S. were at <placeName ref="pl3322">Beechwood</placeName>, but I found
                    several of his Handwriting in <persName ref="pe0138">L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Macclesfield</persName>'s 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0078">Collection</title></bibl>, 
                    besides several Volumes which I presume must have been 
                    his Property.<note type="editorial">Edward Lhuyd's hand in the Macclesfield collection (now NLW, Llanstephan 1–154) is limited to 
                    five manuscripts (Llanstephan 4, 84, 137, 145 and 185). Of these, two are compilations of Lhuyd's, a Cornish vocabulary 
                    dated <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1700 (Llanstephan 84), 
                    and a pocket field notebook of 1698 (Llanstephan 185). Daniel Huws, <hi rend="italic">A Repertory of Welsh Manuscripts and Scribes</hi>

                <p>I rode one Morning to <placeName ref="pl2876">Berkhamsted</placeName> and called at 
                    <persName ref="pe0145">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeffreys</persName>'s but had not the good Fortune to find him at Home, 
                    however I had the Pleasure to hear that all the Family were well. I enclose herewith a Frank which I procured at 
                    <placeName ref="pl3322">Beechwood</placeName> agreeably to the Request mentioned in your Favour which I received on my Arrival there.
                    I propose going to <persName ref="pe0138">L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Macclesfield</persName>'s to morrow, and to examine
                    his Lordships's M.S.S. once more. If any thing occurs worth your Attention you may depend upon receiving it with all possible
                    Expedition. I am
