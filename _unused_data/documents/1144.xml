                <p>I should have given some sort of answer to your letter before this time, if I could have procur’d from the tedious 
                    <persName ref="pe0328">Falder</persName>, the parcell I had directed him to send to <placeName ref="pl0759">my house</placeName>.
                    It is just now gone to the <placeName ref="pl1990">Golden Cross</placeName>, at <placeName ref="pl2001">Charing Cross</placeName>, directed to You, at <placeName ref="pl0001">Downing</placeName>, 
                    and I hope will set off by the Monday’s Coach, at latest, but before my letter is seal’d, I shall be able to give you more certain information with respect to that Matter.</p>
                <p>upon the receit of your Letter, desir<del>d</del>ing me to send down my set of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">Arctic Zoology</title></bibl> 
                    Prints up<hi rend="underline">on  large paper,</hi> to be colour’d, I open’d the parcell, which I had never done before, and to my almost dispair, 
                    I find I have no others, except what you will receive in the packet coming to <placeName ref="pl0001">Downing</placeName>,
                    and pour Comble de Malheur,<note type="editorial">'to make things worse'.</note> the letter press is upon <hi rend="underline">small-paper</hi>,
                    or at least upon paper, a great deal smaller, than the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">Introduction</title></bibl>
                    <sic>perces</sic> me, which is so well illustrated by <persName ref="pe0014">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gryfyth</persName>. 
                    how therefore can I contrive to bind them up together, without manifestly injuring the fine large paper <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">introduction</title></bibl>,
                    by being under the necessity of cutting off some of the Drawings, to reduce that and the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">Zoology</title></bibl> to equal size? I know not where to get the body of the 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">arctic Zoology</title></bibl> upon large paper, nor in truth do I ever remember to have seen a copy upon paper equally large, and fine, as is my 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">introduction</title></bibl>. take my distress into your consideration, and advise me what to do.</p>
                <p>A Sucking Nabob, promiss’d to send me a satisfactory answer respecting <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0417">De Perrons travels in India &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.</title></bibl>
                    but he has not yet done it. No body does any thing without being worried again and again, as I mean to do him. accept my blessing, and every good wish to you, and your house, 
                    and The Beggars blessing into the Bargain, tho I doubt one part of it will not be of much service either to you, or myself.</p>

                    <p>P.S.  the parcell goes by to nights mail coach, and the Carriage, and booking together, being <hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.</hi> is paid. - </p>
                    <p>The <del>Booksell</del>Book keeper would not receive it without payment, which seem'd to me quite <add place="above">an</add> 
                        innovation, and upon no other road requird. I want to be informd whether I ought to have submitted to it. –</p>
