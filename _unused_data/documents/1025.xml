Note, however, that Pennant refers later in this letter to a 'pyrated edition' of the book as well, which suggests that it was more widely available than would be expected in advance of its formal publication. On the publication date of <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi>, see further Thomas Pennant to David Pennant, 20 January 1784: 'I have almost printed my arctic zoology'.
