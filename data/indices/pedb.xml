                            Intelligencer (1791-1794) and Recreations in Agriculture (1799-1802).
                            Significant works by Anderson include Enquiry into the Nature of the
                            Corn Laws (1777) and The Interest of Great Britain with Respect to the
                            American Colonies (1782). Anderson was at one point an associate of
                            Jeremy Bentham and the latter's famous plan for the Panopticon, a new
                            model of penitentiary, was printed in The Bee. Unpaid subscriptions and
                            a run-in with the authorities over the printing of politically radical
                            materials contributed to the cancellation of The Bee in 1794. Anderson
                            Married Margaret Seton in 1768 and took over the running of the family
                            farm of Monkshill. He later moved to Edinburgh and then London, dying in
                            Essex in 1808. ; Aberdeen University Library, MS 2787/4/4/8, Papers of

                            of York in 1776. Markham's rise reflected his close relationship with

                            Mansfield, which had led him to the post of tutor to the prince of Wales
                            and Prince Frederick. After a sermon he gave in 1777, Markham came to be
                            seen by some as a monarchist and enemy of dissenters, leading to a

                            politics of the Civil War. In 1661 Sharp became a supporter of
                            episcopacy and subsequently became archbishop of St Andrews. After a
                            period of declining influence and reputation, Sharp was murdered by a
                            band of covenanters while en route to St Andrews through Fife in 1679.

                        <note>Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) was a naturalist and landowner, and
                            President of the Royal Society from 1778-1820. A Linnaean botanist,
                            Banks accompanied Constantine Phipps to Labrador and Newfoundland in
                            1766, and rose to national prominence as a member of James Cook's voyage
                            to the South Pacific on the ship Endeavour between 1768-1771. A public
                            dispute with the Admiralty saw Banks withdraw from Cook's Resolution
                            expedition in 1772, leading him to organise his own voyage to Iceland in
                            the same year. Accompanied by the naturalist Daniel Solander, the
                            linguist Uno Von Troil and the artists John Cleveley and James and John
                            Frederick Miller, Banks sailed to Iceland via the Western Isles of
                            Scotland, where he visited Fingal's Cave on Staffa. Banks gifted the
                            visual and written record of the island's basaltic columns made on his
                            voyage to Thomas Pennant, who visited the Hebrides later in the summer
                            of 1772 but was unable to land on Staffa. On his return from Iceland
                            Banks landed in Orkney, where the clergymen George Low acted as a guide
                            to the archipelago's antiquities and natural history. Banks's account of
                            Staffa later appeared verbatim in Pennant's A tour in Scotland, and
                            voyage to the Hebrides (1774) and was the only part of his Iceland
                            journal to be published within his lifetime. Pennant acknowledged
                            Banks's generosity with a glowing dedication in the same volume, though
                            his relationship with Banks was later soured over Pennant's unauthorised
                            purchase of drawings by one of Banks's artists for use in his Arctic
                            Zoology. Banks's London home at 32 Soho Square became a centre of study
                            and meeting-place for European naturalists, while he used his presidency
                            of the Royal Society to promote natural history (at the expense, his
                            rivals felt, of the mathematical sciences), particularly where it served

                            correspondence with Richard Bull. In December 1777 he purchased the
                            freedom of the city and was able to start a business of his own, whilst
                            an annuity granted in 1785 allowed him to give up his work as a barber

                            shop. Plans for publishing his work, which amounted to almost 900
                            plates, of which only 362 survive, were incomplete at the time of his
                            death, but it was published posthumously in monthly parts by Hugh Paton,

                        <note>Mark Catesby (1683-1749) was an English naturalist, influenced by his
                            uncle's acquaintance with John Ray. Catesby journeyed to Virginia in
                            1712, where he stayed with a relative, and continued on to Carolina and
                            the West Indies before returning to England in 1719, having amassed
                            significant natural history collections. He returned to America in 1722
                            with assistance from the naturalist Hans Sloane, and once back in
                            England began to publish The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and
                            the Bahama Islands (1729-1747). The work went through several editions

                        <note>John Hope (1725‚Äì1786) was Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden in
                            Edinburgh and professor of botany at the University of Edinburgh. Hope
                            trained in medicine at Edinburgh and Glasgow and studied botany in
                            Paris. He was a founding member of the Select Society alongside Adam
                            Smith and David Hume, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Hope was a
                            proponent for the foundation of a natural history museum in Edinburgh,
                            and with the support of Joseph Banks, was instrumental in establishing a
                            new botanic garden away from the original, polluted site in the centre
                            of the city. Hope was an important Scottish proponent of Linnaean
                            systematic botany, training multiple apprentices (including James
                            Robertson) to conduct surveys in the Highlands. While keen to document
                            Scotland's native flora, Hope, like Linnaeus, also championed the
                            introduction of exotic species to northern climes, seeing them as a
                            potential source of commercial and environmental enrichment. Fredrik

                        <note>John Murray (1737-1793) [formerly McMurray] was born in Edinburgh and
                            served in the navy during the Seven Years' War. In 1768 he purchased
                            William Sandby's stock and bookshop on Fleet Street. Although he may
                            have changed his name to further his career in the metropolitan
                            booktrade, Murray maintained strong links with Edinburgh (sending his
                            son and successor to school there) and with his fellow Scottish
                            booksellers in London. He aligned himself with Edinburgh, rather than
                            London booksellers during the literary property dispute of 1774,
                            favouring the abolition of perpetual copyright, which allowed him to
                            produce cheap editions of older works. He primarily copublished works of
                            Scottish authorship with Edinburgh booksellers such as William Creech,
                            John Bell and Charles Elliot, including John Millar's Essay on the
                            Distinction of Ranks. By his death in 1793 Murray had built up a
                            considerable fortune and book business; his son, also called John Murray
                            (1778-1843), would go on to become one of the most important publishers
                            of the early nineteenth century. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Richard B.

                            from the Pennant family even after the death of Thomas Pennant. He
                            accompanied Pennant on his 1772 Scottish tour, his illustrations
                            published in A tour in Scotland and voyage to the Hebrides in 1774, and
                            was also the illustrator for his Welsh tours. Moses Griffith married
                            Margaret Jones on 9 January 1781, and they had two children, Moses and

                            Flintshire, and Gloddaeth, Caernarvonshire. He married Margaret,
                            daughter of Revd Hugh Wynn, Bodysgallen and Berthddu, and his wife,
                            Catherine. He was a vice-president of the Welsh Charity School in
                            London, and his Welsh cultural interests are signalled by the fact that
                            Evan Evans dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Some Specimens of the Poetry
                                of the Antient Welsh Bards</hi> (1764) to him. In December 1792 he
                            became a member of the Loyalist Flintshire Association promoted by his
                            brother-in-law, Thomas Pennant. Mostyn's relationship with Pennant is
                            evinced in the latter's correspondence by Pennant's frequent use of

                        <note>John Campbell (c.1703-1777), son of Colin Campbell of Ardmaddy, worked
                            at the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1727 and was cashier during the
                            Jacobite occupation of Edinburgh in 1745. Campbell was called on by
                            Charles Edward Stuart to withdraw gold from the bank's reserves to
                            honour notes held by the prince. Campbell retreived the gold from
                            Edinburgh Castle where it had been placed for safekeeping during the
                            hostilities. In later years, Campbell was a patron of James Macpherson
                            and supporter of the Gaelic language. He was painted in full Highland
                            dress by William Mosman, (1759).

                            Thomas Pennant on his 1772 Scottish Tour, and maintained a
                            correspondence with him, supplying him with information about Scottish
                            natural history, antiquities, and Gaelic: many of these letters are held
                            in Warwick County Archives. Trained in Linnaean botany at Edinburgh
                            University, he botanised with Dr John Walker as well as Edward
                            Lightfoot, author of Flora Scotica (1777) who also accompanied Pennant.
                            Stuart completed his father's Bible translations and published his own
                            translation of the Old Testament in 1801. He was also responsible for
                            editing and publishing the songs of the great Gaelic poet Duncan Ban
                            Macintyre of Glenorchy, some of which had been earlier transcribed by
                            Rev Donald MacNicol of Lismore. In 1792 Stuart married Susan Macintyre,
                            daughter of Dr Joseph Macintyre, minister of Glenorchy: the couple had
                            four children. Stuart established a botanical garden at the manse in
                            Luss, contributed a description of the Parish of Luss to the First
                            Statistical Account of Scotland, and was an important contributor to the
                            network of Gaelic speaking ministers who constituted the 'Gaelic
                            enlightenment'. He is buried in the graveyard of Luss Kirk. (See <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>: article by George Stronach, rev. by

                        <note>James Boswell (1740-1795) was a diarist and biographer of
                            his friend Dr Samuel Johnson. Born in Edinburgh, Boswell was heir to the
                            Auchinleck estate in Ayrshire. He rejected the legal career followed by
                            his Calvinist father to pursue literature and society in London. Boswell
                            accompanied Dr Johnson on his celebrated Scottish tour in
                            August-November 1773, and the journal he kept was an important source
                            for Johnson's Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland published in
                            1775. Boswell published his own Journey of a Tour to the Hebrides with
                            Samuel Johnson, LL.D in 1785, after Johnson's death: prepare with
                            assistance from Edward Malone, it was partly intended as a first step
                            towards his monumental Life of Johnson (1791), but also represented an
                            excercise in damage limitation, given the negative reaction to Johnson's
                            book in Scotland. Boswell was no admirer of Pennant, given the latter's
                            Whig principles and antipathy to Jacobitism, a cause dear to Boswell's
                            heart. </note>

                        <note>James Bruce of Kinnaird (1730-1794), later known for his
                            travels in Africa, dropped out of his legal studies at Edinburgh
                            University and moved to London where he married Adriana Allan, the
                            daughter of a wine merchant. After Adriana died from consumption in
                            Paris in 1754, Bruce embarked on a European tour, returning on the death
                            of his father to the family estate of Kinnaird, the coal mines of which
                            would provide him with income to pursue his interest in travel. Bruce
                            served briefly as consul-general at Algiers, before visiting the Roman
                            ruins at Algiers and Tunis with his artist Luigi Balugani. He
                            subsequently made further travels in North Africa and Syria, before
                            making for Abyssinia where he hoped to discover the source of the Nile.
                            After several eventful years in Africa, Bruce returned to Europe in
                            1773, was feted at the royal courts of France and Italy, but was met
                            with a more sceptical reception in Britain. Bruce's<hi rend="italic">Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</hi> did not appear in
                            print until 1790, but became an international bestseller. He died
                            after falling down the stairs in 1794; many contemporaries and later
                            travellers questioned the authenticity of his account of Abbysnia. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            of Scotland in 1780. Buchan was educated at the universities of St
                            Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow, at the latter of which he also studied
                            drawing, etching, and engraving under the Foulis brothers. Buchan
                            subsequently produced drawings of antiquities on Iona which were
                            published in the Transactions of the Antiquaries of Scotland (vol. 1,
                            1792). Buchan allied himself to reformist political causes domestically,
                            and supported American independence; during the 1790s he joined the
                            London Society of the Friends of the People. Buchan's political
                            interests ran parallel to his antiquarian activities and patronage of
                            Scottish writers, reflecting a brand of patriotism that saw in elements
                            of Scotland's pre-1707 past and figures such as William Wallace, the
                            symbols of an ancient constitutional liberty. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

                        <note>George Buchanan (1506-1582) was a scholar and politician born in
                            Killearn, Stirlingshire. He studied at St Andrews and Paris, and was
                            appointed tutor to a son of James V. Buchanan later returned to teach in
                            France, where he wrote several plays. Returning from the continent in
                            the 1560s, he was admitted into the privy council of Mary Stuart, but
                            following her abdication and imprisonment he joined her opponents.
                            Buchanan was subsequently tutor to James VI. In 1579 he published the
                            political dialogue De jure regni, a defence of the principle that the
                            subjects of the realm were entitled to depose bad monarchs. 1582 saw the
                            publication of Rerum Scoticarum historia, a work that conformed to the
                            constitutional politics of De jure regni, and chronicled the reigns of
                            Scotland's mythical Fergusian kings. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

                            partner to Andrew Millar. On Millar's death in 1768, Cadell assumed
                            control of the business and entered into an enduring (though never
                            legally formalised) partnership with the printer William Strahan. Cadell
                            and Strahan purchased many of Millar's former copyrights to works by
                            Scottish authors such as Adam Smith, and expanded their stock and

                            Kincaid. By his death Cadell was a wealthy man; his book business was

                        <note>Adam Mansfeldt de Cardonnel [formerly Adam Cardonnel] (1746/7‚Äì1820),
                            was an antiquary with a particular interest in numismatics, or the study
                            of coins and medals. His father Mansfeldt de Cardonnel (1696/7‚Äì1780) was
                            a commissioner of the customs in Scotland, suggesting the root of his
                            connection with George Paton, a customs clerk and correspondent of
                            Thomas Pennant. Adam trained and briefly practised as a surgeon but
                            devoted most of his time to his antiquarian interests. He was a fellow
                            and curator of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. In 1786 he
                            published the self-illustrated Numismata Scoti√¶, or a series of the
                            Scottish coinage, from the reign of William the Lion to the Union. His
                            Picturesque antiquities of Scotland (1788-93) evinced his skill and
                            interest in drawing Scottish scenery, and from Pennant's correspondence
                            with Paton, it seems that some of Cardonnel's work had found its way
                            into Pennant's hands as early as 1773. Cardonnel assisted his fellow
                            antiquarian Francis Grose during the latter's tour of Scotland, and in
                            1789 he received letters on Grose's behalf from the poet Robert Burns.

                        <note>MacQueen, Donald,
                            c.1715-1785. Rev Donald MacQueen was Presbyterian minister of Kilmuir in
                            Skye, and according to the Fasti, 'probably the best known and most
                            distinguished minister in the Highlands in his time'. We don't know
                            which university he attended, but he was ordained in 1740, and his first
                            wife was Betsy Martin, a neice of the celebrated Skye author Martin
                            Martin. Although as a minister he sought to purge his parishioners of
                            superstitious beliefs, Macqueen was a considerable authority on Gaelic
                            history, folklore and antiquities, and in 1760 assisted James Macpherson
                            to collect Ossianic fragments. Dohmnall Uilleam Stuibhart writes that
                            while McQueen could certainly read Gaelic orthography, and owned old
                            manuscripts, later donated to the Society of Antiquaries, he was 'one of
                            the last educated generation to write Gaelic with English
                            orthography...[causing] headaches for his Gaelic speaking
                            correspondents'. MacQueen missed Pennant when he visited Kilmuir in
                            1772, but soon established an important correspondence with him, much of
                            which survives in the Warwick County Archives and in the NLW. Above all
                            he furnished him with an important 'Dissertatation on the Government of
                            the People in the Western Isles', published as an appendix to Pennant's
                            Tour in Scotland 1772, as well a information on local superstitions,
                            notably second sight and the 'Gruagach' or brownie. In Sept 1773 he
                            spent three weeks travelling around Skye with Johnson and Boswell,
                            furnishing them with antiquarian information, and was the butt of
                            Johnson's desire to prove the inauthentiticy of Ossian. (Macqueen
                            refused to give the Doctor satisfaction on this matter.) Boswell
                            described him as 'a decent minister, an elderly man with his own black
                            hair, courteous and rather slow of speech, but candid, sensible, and
                            well-informed, nay, learned'. Johnson is recorded by Boswell as saying
                            'this is a critical man, sir. there must be as great vigour of mind to
                            make him cultivate learning so much in the Isle of Skye, where he might
                            do without it. It is wonderful how many of the new publications he has'.
                            [TH, p. 153] From 1777 to his death Macqueen corresponded with Rev John
                            Stuart of Luss, commenting on his Gaelic translations of the
                            Bible.</note>

                            <note>Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì1784), was born at Lichfield, son of
                            a bookseller, and educated at Pembroke College, Oxford. His most famous
                            work was the English Dictionary of 1755. As essayist, critic, poet,
                            dramatist, editor and lexicographer, he was the dominant figure (the
                            'Grand Cham') of mid 18th century English literature. In 1773 he made a
                            100 day tour of Scotland with James Boswell, and in 1775 published <hi rend="italic">A
                            Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</hi>, which caused much offence in
                            Scotland, and was unfavourably compared by reviewers to Pennant's
                            <hi rend="italic">Tours</hi>. Despite his hostility to Macpherson's Ossian and his frequently
                            Scotophobic comment, Johnson was a sponsor for the SSPCK's Gaelic
                            translation of the Bible. As a Tory in politics and a high Anglican in
                            religion, he famously commented on Thomas Pennant: 'He's a Whig, Sir: a
                            sad dog ... But he's the best traveler I ever read; he observes more
                            things than anyone else does'. </note>

                            part of Prussia, travelled to Russia in 1765, in the hope of fulfilling
                            an ambition to work in a scientific field. He later moved to London,
                            where he sought to engage with the British science community. From 1768
                            he worked as a tutor at the Warrington Academy, then accompanied Cook on
                            his second voyage around the globe (between 1772 and 1775). He worked
                            closely with Pennant, who supported his efforts to publish translations
                            of travel writing including Peter Kalm's <hi rend="italic">Travels into North America</hi> and
                            Peter Osbeck's <hi rend="italic">A Voyage to China and the East Indies</hi> (1771). In his
                            translation work, Forster was aided by his son, Georg Adam Forster
                            (1754‚Äì94), although this is not generally acknowledged. Forster's <hi rend="italic">A

                        <note>Alexander Webster (1707‚Äì1784) was a Church of Scotland
                            minister and demographer, awarded DD by Edinburgh University c.1760.
                            Along with the Reverend Robert Wallace, he devised a scheme for the
                            relief of the widows of Scottish clergymen, based on a precisely
                            calculated rate of contribution. Webster was responsible for an
                            important parish survey of Scotland's population in 1755. In a letter of
                            12 November 1773 to George Paton, Thomas Pennant writes: 'I beg my best

                            writer, bookseller and farmer originally from Aberdeenshire. In the
                            1760s Douglas wrote in support of the controversial but highly popular
                            'Douglas Cause' of Archibald Douglas, who claimed inheritance of the
                            lands of the Douglas dukedom, against the powerful duke of Hamilton to
                            whom they had passed. He was apparently rewarded for his services with
                            an extensive farm at Abbots-Inch near Paisley. Francis Douglas's works

                            Edinburgh. He undertook various jobs in Perthshire, including designing
                            Innerpeffray Library in 1739. In 1756 he was elected a member of the
                            Royal Company of Archers and in 1763 to the Canongate Kilwinning Masonic
                            Lodge. In 1761 he was admitted a burgess of Edinburgh by right of his
                            father when he was described as a wright by trade. In the early 1770s he
                            was a 'tacksman' of the mines in Islay and was involved with the sale of
                            their lease. He died probably in 1781 as a meeting of his creditors was
                            called in January 1782 at which point he is described as 'the deceased
                            Charles Freebairn, late architect in Edinburgh' (<ref type="http" target="http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=408022">see here</ref>). Freebairn also has interests in mines in the Ochil
                            Hills, in Loch Fyne, and was a projector of the Crinan Canal. He
                            entertained Pennant on 1st-2nd July 1772, at his home of Freeport, near
                            Port Askaig on Islay, and showed him round the lead mines, which he had
                            managed since 1763, as tacksman of Daniel Campbell of Shawfield,
                            proprietor of Islay. He was also visited by Joseph Banks and his party
                            the following month, en route for Iceland on 5th August 1772. Banks
                            described his house as 'situated in a very romantick spot under an
                            almost overhanging clift close by the sea side here not above an English
                            mile in breadth...Near his house is a very good air furnace at which he
                            smelts the lead produced by his mines'. There is a painting of his house

                            popularized the field of antiquarianism. Known as 'Captain Grose'
                            following his promotion to captain in the Surrey regiment of the militia
                            in 1765, Grose had shown an early interest in sketching. In 1772 he
                            published the first number of <hi rend="italic">The Antiquities of
                                England and Wales</hi>, a work in an innovative format offering a

                            taken (with acknowledgement) from published books or from fellow
                            antiquaries, at other times from material collected through
                            correspondence. Tours in 1788, 1789 and 1790 lead to the publication
                                of <hi rend="italic">The Antiquities of Scotland</hi>, but Grose died

                        <note>John Frazer (d.1702) was minister of
                            Tiree and Coll from 1676, in which role he was styled Dean of the Isles.
                            He was reputed by Pennant and others to have inherited from his father a
                            volume of inscriptions copied from monuments around the Abbey and
                            Nunnery of Iona that had been destroyed in the Reformation. The
                            inscriptions were supposedly given to the earls of Argyll and
                            subsequently lost. The source of this anecdote is likely William

                            from 1693 and a baronet of Nova Scotia from 1698. Dalrymple's
                            Collections Concerning the Scottish History (1705) refuted a politically
                            charged claim that the Church of Scotland was once under the archdiocese
                            of York, placing him in the company of contemporary patriotic Scottish
                            scholars such as Robert Sibbald. Dalrymple's later Vindication of the

Following the Jacobite defeat at Culloden in 1746, MacDonald accompanied Charles Edward Stuart, disguised as her maid, on his crossing to Skye from the Outer Hebrides, pursued by government forces. Following Charles Edward's escape to France, MacDonald was detained, questioned, and sent to London. She returned to Skye in 1747, where she later married Allan MacDonald of Kingsburgh, with whom she had seven children. The MacDonalds were visited by Johnson and Boswell in 1773, and a year later they emirated to America, where their loyalty to the government during the revolution led to Allan's imprisonment and their eventual return to Skye, where they remained for the rest of their lives. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note></persName></person><person xml:id="pe0120"><persName><surname>Macleod (n√©e MacDonald)</surname><forename/><roleName>Mrs</roleName><addName ref="1"/><note>Mrs Macleod (fl.1814), a daughter of the Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald.</note></persName></person><person xml:id="pe0121"><persName><surname>Burt</surname><forename/><roleName>Dr</roleName><addName ref="1"/><note>An unidentified Dr Burt of Edinburgh, mentioned by Charlotte Malkin in her 1814 tour.</note></persName></person>

                        <note>Lawrence Dundas (1712-1781), became wealthy as an
                            army commissary for the duke of Cumberland, first in Scotland after the
                            defeat of the Jacobite rising in 1746, and then in Flanders. Dundas
                            purchased the estate of Kerse in Stirlingshire and used his wealth to
                            ensure his election as MP for Linlithgow in 1747. Complaints of
                            electoral corruption from the duke of Argll and prime minister Henry
                            Pelham led to Dundas losing his seat a year later. Dundas's business as
                            a supplier to the army brought him further riches as a result of the
                            Seven Years' War, allowing him to purchase more land in Scotland,
                            England and Ireland, as well as a baronetcy and seat in Parliament.
                            Dundas also purchased slave plantations in Dominca and Grenada. Dundas's
                            vast wealth and property earned him the nickname 'the Nabob of the
                            North.' At the same time, he built a political power base around his
                            Edinburgh seat, allying himself to Lord North, though in the 1770s he
                            faced a concerted challenge from a different branch of the Dundas
                            family, led by Henry Dundas, lord advocate of Scotland and later
                            Viscount Melville. Due to their possession of considerable lands in
                            Orkney, Dundas and his son Thomas were approached on behalf of the
                            naturalist George Low, who sought preferment as minister for the
                            parishes of Birsay and Harray, a scheme discussed in Thomas Pennant's

He died on 20 November 1798. <hi rend="italic">AO</hi>, II, p. 746; Clergy of the Church of England Database, <ref type="http" target="https://theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/search/index.jsp">here</ref> [accessed 10 July 2020].

                        <note>John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713‚Äì92), was son of
                            James, second earl of Bute, and Lady Anne Campbell, daughter of
                            Archibald, first duke of Argyll. He was educated at Eton and the
                            University of Leiden, and became adviser and tutor to the future George
                            III. Bute's influence over the latter, following his accession, together with his rise to the office of prime minister during 1762‚Äì3, earned him the distrust of much
                            of the press and public. He was a patron of several writers including
                            Tobias Smollet and Samuel Johnson, and of the anatomist William Hunter.
                            He was also a keen botanist and patron of the Royal Botanic Gardens at

                        <note>George Low (1747-1795) was a Church of Scotland minister
                            and naturalist, educated at Marischal College Aberdeen and the
                            University of St Andrews. In the late 1760s he became tutor to a
                            merchant family in Stromness, Orkney, and later the minister of
                            Cairston; he became an ardent observer of the archipelago's natural
                            history and antiquities. Low became the local guide to Joseph Banks and
                            his party when they visited Orkney on the return leg of their voyage to
                            Iceland, and it is likely that this meeting catalysed his introduction
                            to an increasingly fashionable culture of northern antiquarianism and
                            natural inquiry in which Thomas Pennant, Richard Gough and others were
                            fellow participants. Pennant patronised Low's tour of Orkney and
                            Shetland in 1774, intending for him to write and publish on a region
                            which Pennant had not reached in either of his two tours of Scotland.
                            Shortly after, Low became minister of Birsay and Harray through the
                            patronage of Sir Laurence Dundas. Low married in 1775, but his wife
                            Helen (n√©e Tyrie) died the following year. Low continued to work on an
                            expansive body of work relating to Orkney and Shetland, comprising a
                            History, Fauna, and Flora of the islands, alongside his tour,
                            undertaking further travels to complete his research. Pennant had been
                            unable to secure a publisher for Low's tour though much of his writing
                            was shared with Pennant and Gough, who made liberal use of it in their
                            Arctic Zoology (1784-87) and British Topography (1780) respectively.
                            Low's health declined in the 1780s,and he died in 1795, having
                            contributed a description of Birsay to Sinclair's Statistical Account
                            (1791-99). The manuscripts of Low's 'Tours', 'Flora Orcadensis', and
                            'History of Orkney', are now held variously at Edinburgh University
                            Library, the National Museums of Scotland, and the National Library of
                            Scotland, with further descriptions comprising parts of collections of

                            retired in 1824: he is commemorated by a plaque in the west wall of the
                            new kirk, built in 1810 during his long incumbency. He married Christian
                            MacVean (1747-1797), daughter of the previous incumbent, John MacVean.
                            Pennant visited Dalmally in 1769 and described MacIntyre's manse as
                            'neat, and his little demesne is decorated in the most advantageous
                            places with seats of turf, indicatig the content and satisfaction of the
                            possessor of the lot Providence has given him': MacIntyre is thanked by

                            describes the medieval gravestones in the churchyard. MacIntyre
                            contributed an account of the Parish to the first Statistical Account,
                            and began keeping parish records. Pennant's travelling companion in
                            1772, John Stuart of Killin, may have been recommended to him by
                            Macintyre. Stuart married Macintyre's daughter Susan, and his own sister
                            was married to Rev James Maclagan of Blair Atholl, exemplifying the
                            strong family links connecting 18th century Highland ministers.

                        <note>John Bell of Antermony, Stirlingshire (1691-1780), was a diplomat and
                            traveller in Russia and Asia. He was sent to Esfahan on behalf of Tsar
                            Peter I in 1715 and later to Beijing. After another misson to Persia in
                            1722 he returned to Scotland, but came back St Petersburg in 1734.
                            Subsequent diplomatic missions took him to Constantinople, where he
                            settled for some time, before marrying the Russian Mary Peters in 1746
                            and returning to his family estate at Antermony. There he wrote his
                            Travels from St Petersburg in Russia to Various Parts of Asia, published
                            by the Foulis brothers of Glasgow in 1763.</note>

                            bookseller. After ending his partnership with Alexander Kincaid in 1758,
                            Donaldson opened his own bookshop and a separate print shop in
                            Edinburgh, where he focused on producing cheap reprints of older English
                            authors such as Milton and Pope. With his brother John, Donaldson opened
                            a shop in London as an outlet through which he sought to undercut local
                            monopoly with his low-cost product. This earned Donaldson the ire of the
                            London booksellers, and led to a decisive legal case in 1774, in which
                            the House of Lords ruled in Donaldson's favour and against the principle
                            of perpetual copyright. Reflecting his continued links with the Scottish
                            print world, Donaldson founded the Edinburgh Advertiser newspaper in
                            1764. Donaldson retired to Broughton Hall near Edinburgh, where he died
                            in 1794, leaving a considerable fortune to his son James. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Richard B. Sher, The Enlightenment and the

                        <note>Charles Elliot (1748-1790) was an Edinburgh bookseller, unusual among
                            his peers for purchasing expensive literary properties in multi-volume
                            medical and scientific works by Scottish authors, including books by
                            William Cullen and William Smellie's Philosophy of Natural History.
                            Elliot operated from a shop in Parliament Square and in 1787 opened a
                            premises in the Strand in London, from which he primarily sold Scottish
                            medical works. Elliot was savvy in forming alliances with other
                            booksellers in London and Newcastle, as well as becoming involved in
                            businesses in Dublin and Philadelphia. Pennant's correspondence with
                            George Paton documents Elliot's efforts to position himself as Pennant's
                            primary bookseller in Scotland, though the letters also suggest that the
                            returns from this venture were commercially dissapointing. Richard B.

                        <note>Robert Gordon (1580-1661) was educated in Aberdeen and Paris. He is
                            best known as a map-maker who collaborated with Joan Blaeu and Timothy
                            Pont, contributing significantly to the former's 1654 Atlas of Scotland.
                            There is much evidence however that Gordon's cartographic ambitions
                            extended beyond his work with Pont and Blaeu. The National Library of
                            Scotland holds 65 unpublished manuscript maps by Gordon, which Jeffrey
                            C. Stone suggests are unrelated to his involvement with Blaeu, and
                            indicate a separate design of unknown origins and aims.

                            Marischal College where he taught and practised medicine. Like Pennant,
                            he was a keen naturalist, and <persName ref="pe0140">Carl

                            have commenced when Pennant paid a visit to the former‚Äôs cabinet of
                            natural history specimens while passing through Aberdeen during his 1769
                            tour of Scotland, and they afterwards corresponded, largely on matters
                            relating to natural history and specimen exchange. Skene was a member of
                            the Aberdeen Philosophical society along with Thomas Reid and <persName ref="pe1347">James Beattie</persName> and was Dean of Faculty at
                            Marischal College, Aberdeen from 1767 to 1770. Skene's other
                            correspondents included Linnaeus; Henry Home, Lord Kames (whom he
                            provided with a 'reciept for a moss dunghill'); <persName ref="pe0040">Lord Buchan</persName> and the botanists <persName ref="pe0012">Dr

                            Gwyn, Pentraeth, Anglesey, he became the owner of a substantial estate

                        <note>Thomas Pennant (1726‚Äì98) was a naturalist, writer and antiquarian
                            well known for his published accounts of pioneering tours throughout the
                            British Isles. He was born and lived at the family estate, Downing Hall
                            near Whitford, Flintshire, in north-east Wales. He was educated in
                            Wrexham and Oxford.He was the son of David Pennant (d. 1763), landowner,
                            and a member of the Pennant family who owned the estate centred upon an
                            ancient house at Bychton since Norman conquest. Pennant's mother was
                            Arabella, (d. 1744), 3rd daughter of Richard Mytton, of Halston,
                            Shropshire. Pennant‚Äôs publications on natural history include such works
                            as British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, and Arctic Zoology. He
                            was a fine observer in the field, and collected specimens of plants,
                            minerals, birds and animals. But his knowledge of the natural world also
                            came from a wide international network of leading scientific figures of
                            his day ‚Äì his correspondents included figures such as Linnaeus, Joseph
                            Banks and Gilbert White of Selbourne. He was a passionate antiquarian,
                            with an interest in the Roman remains and artefacts around Chester and a
                            deep curiosity about the British past. An enthusiast for economic
                            improvement and a champion of burgeoning industry (he opened a lead-mine
                            on his own estate) Pennant was politically conservative, becoming more
                            reactionary in the decade of unrest after the French Revolution. His
                            writings nonetheless reveal a thoughtful and generous-spirited man with
                            a social conscience, who was deeply moved by the conditions of poverty
                            he encountered on his travels. Pennant published accounts of tours in
                            several parts of Britain, but he is best known for two consecutive Tours
                            in Scotland made in 1769 and 1772, and the Tour in Wales, published in
                            parts between 1778-1784. He travelled on horseback, on foot, and, in the
                            Western Isles, by boat, and it is this immediacy of experience combined
                            with his many and varied interests which make these tours such
                            fascinating reading. Hugely influential on later travellers to Wales and
                            Scotland, they are rich in observations and descriptions which bring the
                            vibrant complexities of eighteenth-century Britain to life. His
                            long-standing patronage of the artist Moses Griffith and others such as
                            John Ingleby and Paul Sandby ensured that these written descriptions
                            were matched with a superb range of landscapes and miniatures, many
                            painted directly into lavish extra-illustrated versions of the tours. He
                            was married twice, in 1759 to Elizabeth Falconer (d. 1764), and in 1778
                            to Ann Mostyn of Mostyn Hall, the adjacent estate to Downing. He had two
                            children from each marriage, and his eldest son David inherited the
                            estate. When he died at the age of seventy two he was a recognized
                            literary figure ‚Äì and had become, by a nice irony, a ‚Äòfeature‚Äô on the
                            itinerary of his own Tour. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            Pennant by his first wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Falconer). As a young woman
                            she divided her time between Downing and the home of her aunt, Catherine
                            Pennant, at Upper Grosvenor Street in London, and upon the latter's
                            death appears to have inherited a substantial sum of money. Her
                            financial independence is signalled by her contribution of ¬£25 to the
                            fund for setting up 'The Loyal Holywell Volunteers' in March 1797, and
                            by her decision to marry, against her father's wishes, Edward, son of
                            Sir Walden Hanmer, in November 1797. Her father's will of February 1798
                            offered her a limited settlement, but a codicil in August of the same
                            year granted her additional sums, alongside her husband and any children
                            (of which there were none). <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Burke, III, p.

                            Aled, who was descended from Marchudd, lord of Uwch Dulas. In 1795 Yorke

                            proprietor of The weekly magazine, or, Edinburgh amusement (1768-1779).
                            Until 1770 he was known as Walter Ruddiman Junior to distinguish him
                            from his uncle of the same name, also an Edinburgh printer. Ruddiman's
                            Weekly might be considered a more successful and longer-lived iteration
                            of his earlier project, the Edinburgh Magazine (1757-1762). The Weekly
                            was Edinburgh's best selling weekly publication, and alongside its
                            extracts and digest of recent news and publications, it was also the
                            medium of the poet Robert Fergusson's first printed work. From 1771
                            Ruddiman's son Thomas became a partner. After 1777 the Weekly was
                            divided into two separate news and literary titles, to exempt the former
                            from the stamp duty levied on newspapers: it continued under the new
                            title of The Edinburgh magazine, or, Literary amusement from 1779 to
                            1782, the year after Walter Ruddiman's death. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>William Smellie (1740-1795) was an Edinburgh printer, editor and
                            author, not to be confused with his distant relative William Smellie,
                            the physician and midwife (1697-1763), though like his namesake, he had
                            a strong interest in medical matters. As editor of the Scots Magazine,
                            Smellie paid particular notice to matters of natural history and
                            medicine, though ultimately the book trade won out over his earlier
                            ambition to pursue his medical studies into a career. Smellie printed
                            works for Charles Elliot, John Murray, William Strahan, William Creech,
                            Peter Hill and others, as well as printing, editing and authoring
                            several important medical books and periodicals. Smellie was
                            commissioned as editor and contributor to the first Encyclopaedia
                            Britannica (1768-71) and translated into English Buffon's Natural
                            History (1780-85). Smellie was also the printer of Maria Riddell's
                            Voyages to the Madeira and Leeward Caribbean Isles (1792); his own
                            Philosophy of Natural History appeared in 1790. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Richard B. Sher, The Enlightenment and the Book

                        <note>John Stuart, first marquess of Bute (1744‚Äì1814),
                            diplomatist, was known in print collecting circles from the mid-1770s,
                            often by the title 'Lord Mountstuart'. This was in recognition of his
                            place of birth, Mount Stuart on the Scottish Isle of Bute, but also
                            became his recognized title when he took the post of envoy to Turin for
                            three years from August 1779. Son of John Stuart, third earl of Bute and
                            prime minister during 1762‚Äì3, the first marquess inherited the south
                            Wales estates of his wife's family of Windsor, and was created Baron
                            Cardiff in 1776. In 1774, Stuart became the purchaser of Richard Bull's

                            as a young man, before taking a seat in parliament as member for
                            Richmond, Yorkshire, and later Stirlingshire. In parliament he supported
                            the Rockingham Whigs. A supporter of Fox in the 1780s, Dundas switched
                            allegiance to Pitt, perhaps in response to the violence of the French
                            Revolution. His political influence gradually declined with the rise of
                            his rival and distant relative, Henry Dundas. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

                            Chester on 11 October 1789. The Pennant-Bull correspondence shows that
                            he spent time at an address in South Audley Street, Mayfair, and that he
                            franked letters for Pennant. His anti-Pittite stance in Parliament would
                            seem to make him a surprising friend to Bull and Pennant, but his
                            Cornish and Cheshire connections may be seen as a reason for his

                            made an advantageous but unhappy marriage to the wealthy London brewer,
                            Henry Thrale. The introduction of Samuel Johnson to Thrale's Streatham
                            Park estate in 1766 lead to a sustained period of activity for Hester as
                            the presider of the Streatham salon, famed as a magnet for writers and
                            intellectuals. In 1784, three years after Thrale's death, Hester married
                            the Italian musician Gabriel Mario Piozzi, with whom she travelled on
                            the continent and, from 1795, retired to Brynbella, Denbighshire. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>The antiquary Sir William Burrell, second baronet
                            (1732‚Äì96), followed a legal career as advocate and was appointed
                            chancellor of the diocese of Worcester in 1764. He succeeded his
                            father-in-law to the title of baronet in 1788. Elected FSA in 1754, by
                            1770 he was working on the history of Sussex. Pennant, <hi rend="italic">From Dover to the Isle of Wight</hi> (1801), p. 46, mentions him as
                            the owner of ‚Äòfine drawings‚Äô of Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex, which
                            was dismantled in 1777, leaving only the outer walls standing. Pennant's
                            regard for Burrell is apparent from the fact that he was one of the few
                            for whom he produced an edition of <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales</hi>

                            physician Dr Thomas Monro in the 1790s. Along with Ker Porter, Underwood
                            belonged to the Sketching Society, also known as ‚Äòthe Brothers‚Äô, founded
                            in May 1799; this tour over the summer of 1799 was probably taken in
                            order to sketch Welsh scenes from real life rather than literary
                            sources, which was the usual practice at meetings of ‚ÄòThe Brothers‚Äô (see
                            also references to the artists Louis Francia and [?John] Varley later in
                            the text). No account of this tour by Underwood, who features throughout
                            Ker Porter‚Äôs narrative, is known to exist, but several undated
                            watercolours at the Tate, which include depictions of Caernarfon Castle,
                            may be products of it. See for example

                            <note>James Granger (<hi rend="italic">bap</hi>. 1723, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1776), vicar of Shiplake,
                            Oxfordshire, and a print collector and biographer, was renowned for his
                            catalogue of engraved historical portraits, (1769), and a supplement
                            which followed in 1774. Granger worked closely with other connoisseurs
                            of art, including Joseph Gulston, Horace Walpole and Richard Bull, with
                            whom he discussed and exchanged prints. So popular was his work that the
                            practice of ornamenting printed works with portraits and other prints
                            became firmly associated with him and his name was lent to a verb, 'to
                            grangerize', intended to describe this fashionable amateur occupation. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>;

In 1770, he was ordained a deacon and then a priest, before being elected a Fellow of Jesus College on 22 October 1773, a post held until 1791.

                            of the north Wales and border county estates of Wynnstay in
                            Denbighshire, Llanforda in Shropshire, Rhiwgoch in Meirioneth, and
                            Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire. He shared his time between London (where
                            he sat as MP from 1772) and Wynnstay, where he had a theatre built. His
                            1771 expedition in north Wales in the company of Paul Sandby, Thomas
                            Apperley and others is believed to have given rise to a fashion for the

                        <note>Paul Sandby (bap. 1731, d. 1809), painter and engraver.
                            Sandby's early career as a draughtsman to the military survey in
                            Scotland gave him the opportunity to work on landscape drawings.
                            Following a move to London in 1752 he became increasingly involved in
                            landscape work, employing various techniques (including pioneering use
                            of aquatint), and exhibited work regularly at the Society of Artists and
                            its successor, the Royal Academy. He was chief drawing master at the
                            Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, 1768‚Äì1796, and was drawing master to
                            patrons including Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Drawings by Sandby published
                            following sketching tours in Wales in 1771 and 1773 and two further
                            series of aquatints of Welsh subjects published in 1777 and 1786 helped
                            to make Wales a popular destination for touring. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Elizabeth Bull (1749‚Äì1809) was the elder of the two
                            daughters of Richard Bull and his wife Mary (n√©e Ash). Described by a
                            contemporary as 'deeply interested in her <sic>fathers</sic> favourite
                            pursuit', she shared Bull's passion for print collecting and was
                            actively involved in pasting and decorating his volumes of engraved
                            portrait heads and other extra-illustrated titles. Alongside her younger
                            sister, Catherine, she inherited a substantial fortune through the death
                            of Sir Humphry Morice, a fact which possibly made a single life both
                            possible and attractive to her. <hi rend="italic">Hist P</hi>; Peltz,

                            Morris Storer (1746‚Äì99), politician and collector, was the son of a
                            wealthy West Indies merchant. He sat in Parliament as member for
                            Carlisle, Cumbria (1774‚Äì80), and for Morpeth, Northumberland (1780‚Äì4),
                            and was appointed by the Fox-North coalition as secretary of the embassy
                            at Paris on 21 September 1783. The post of minister-plenipotentiary to
                            which he was appointed on 13 December that year, was held only very
                            briefly before the fall of the coalition, and Storer failed to be
                            re-elected to parliament after 1784. He was an active collector of
                            prints and books, and an important figure in the world of
                            extra-illustration. Although his fervour for such activity was dampened
                            in the early 1780s by financial difficulties, following his father's
                            death in 1793 he inherited a substantial fortune. His collections were
                            bequeathed to Eton College Library, and included copies of several

                            was appointed rector there in 1778. Pennant relied heavily on Lloyd for
                            translations of Welsh manuscript material, for his extensive knowledge
                            of Welsh history, and for commentary on and correction of the early
                            drafts of the Welsh tours, and acknowledged his debt to him in the
                            'Advertisement' to <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi> (1778), where he
                            described him as 'my constant companion in these excursions'. Lloyd was
                            known to others, too, for his erudition: Iolo Morganwg visited him in
                            1772, Evan Evans in 1786, and he corresponded with Philip Yorke of
                            Erddig, who shared his interest in genealogy. When he died on 22 May
                            1793, Pennant organized a fund to aid his widow Martha (n√©e Williams,

                        <note>Born in Florence, the engraver Francesco Bartolozzi
                            (1728‚Äì1815) was considered as the best engraver in Italy by the 1760s.
                            Having had some of his work published in London in 1763, he was invited
                            there by the art dealer Richard Dalton in 1764 and spent the next 35
                            years working there. He exhibited with the Society of Artists and
                            thereafter at the Royal Academy, and established a vogue for dotted
                            prints or 'stipples'. Most of his work was commanded by printsellers and
                            he had others working for him including Luigi Schiavonetti and John
                            Keyes Sherwin. In 1801 he moved to Lisbon to reform the royal printing
                            press but died at his workshop there in 1815. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            which time he lived in Piccadilly. His three-volume publication, A

                            Flintshire, as a child. He was inspired to become an engraver after

                            became apprenticed in 1741, aged twenty, for a firm of engravers in
                            Holborn. He returned to Wales in 1748 to marry his sweetheart, Elizabeth

                            and the High Peak. He became an alderman in 1782, and was referred to

                            1770, and travelled to Rome in 1774, returning to England by 1776. He
                            exhibited at the Royal Academy in the late 1770s and again in the
                            mid-1780, probably spending the years between 1779 and 1784 visiting
                            Gibraltar and St Petersburg. An exhibition in Pall Mall, London, in
                            1785, showed his enterprise insomuch as it claimed that its contents had
                            been 'painted without commission' and was on offer to 'any nobleman or
                            gentleman who may wish to possess either the whole or a part of them'.
                            It was not a success, but engravings after the pictures were received
                            more positively. He sailed for India in December 1785, and auctioned
                            some of his pictures there between November 1786 and January 1787. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> says
                            that he left India 'about a year later'.</note>

                            although Skrine's parentage has been questioned. In 1777 she married Sir
                            Thomas Clarges, 3rd baronet (1751‚Äì82). After his death she made
                            frequent visits to Italy, before settling in England in 1799. The
                            children of the marriage included Thomas, who succeeded to his father's

                            seditious libel at the Shrewsbury Assizes in August 1784, where he
                            managed to arrest judgement in the case on the grounds that the
                            indictment was defective. In the 1790s, Erskine became an enthusiast for
                            the French Revolution and lawyer for the defence in the treason trials
                            of 1794, where he argued that the London Corresponding Society sought

                            consent was illegal. George III's illness, which steadily worsened from
                            the latter part of 1788, led to the Regency Bill of 12 February 1789,
                            but the king was on the mend before his son needed to take over. George

                            April 1795, with a view to settling his debts. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            the parliamentary seat for Poole (1765‚Äì8 and 1780‚Äì4), but his main
                            passion was book- and print-collecting, which he was enabled to do on
                            inheriting a fortune of ¬£250,000 in funds following the death of his
                            father in 1766. Together with his wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Stepney), an
                            artist and etcher, he built a collection of books and prints, including
                            23,500 British and 18,000 foreign portraits, earning a reputation for
                            rapaciousness. His extravagance gradually led to financial ruin, which
                            he attempted to counteract by the sale in 1775 of his home, Ealing Grove
                            in Middlesex (lavishly transformed into an Italianate villa following
                            his marriage), and of his book and print collections (in 1783/4 and
                            early 1786 respectively). He died on 16 July 1786. Hist P;<hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's

                            (1746‚Äì1820), was responsible for British foreign policy from late 1786

                            1787. In February 1788 he became an ambassador, but his support of Fox
                            during the 1789 Regency crisis briefly put him out of favour with Pitt.
                            During the 1790s he was entrusted with several weighty diplomatic
                            missions, however, including that to Paris from October 1796 and Lille

                            in 1785 but was impeached on 10 May 1787 largely due to the efforts of
                            Edmund Burke, who held him responsible for the rapacious policies of the
                            East India Company in its provinces, its exploitation of its allies, and
                            its wars. The prosecution closed its case on 30 May 1791 but further
                            prosecution speeches were delivered in 1794 before a large majority of
                            the Lords voted ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô the following year. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            and colonial governor. His numerous diplomatic posts involved work as
                            envoy to Russia, Chief Secretary in Ireland, Governor of Madras, an
                            embassy to Peking, a mission to Verona to the exiled Louis the 18th, and
                            the post of governor of the Cape. The embassy to China was undertaken
                            for the joint purposes of the East India Company and the government, who
                            wished to improve conditions for trade with China. A party of 94,
                            including many experts, sailed on the <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi> on 26 September 1792 with
                            samples of the best of British manufactures, which were presented to the
                            Emperor of China on 14 September 1793. Macartney was unable to ensure a
                            treaty of trade and friendship and was handed his dismissal on 3 October
                            1793. Nonetheless, he was raised to an earldom in the Irish peerage in
                            1794 following his return via the southern Chinese province of Canton.

                            interest of Lord Spencer until 1790, but was obliged to renounce his
                            seat at the dissolution of parliament in that year, following an earlier
                            decision to support Pitt against his patron's wishes. Later that year he
                            was returned for the borough of Bossiney, also in Devonshire. Minchin
                            repeatedly (but without success) applied for an Irish peerage, noting
                            his connections and property in Ireland. More profitably he was granted

                            baronet, he succeeded his father on 26 July 1796. In the election to

                            reformer. Theatre work between London and Bristol convinced Palmer of
                            the need for improved communications, involving the replacement of the
                            post boy with a small cart by mail coaches equipped with a box watched
                            over by an armed guard and able to ensure the prompt dispatch of mail.
                            The coaches were exempt from tolls and granted priority over other
                            vehicles so that the momentum of their journeys was sustained. There
                            were differences with the post office, but Palmer shouldered the cost of
                            the reform, in which Pitt had shown an interest. In August 1786, the
                            post office appointed him on suitable terms but his position was not
                            confirmed until July 1789. Pennant was infuriated by the issue of the

                            Both Richard Pennant's parents inherited substantial plantations in
                            Jamaica, and Richard added to the family wealth the Penrhyn estate in
                            Caernarvonshire, through his marriage to Anne Susannah Warburton
                            (1745‚Äì1816) in 1765. A member of parliament for Liverpool (1767‚Äì80;
                            1784‚Äì90), he opposed William Wilberforce‚Äôs campaign for the abolition of
                            slavery in 1787, and the following year spoke in the House of Commons in
                            defence of slave traders and planters. In 1782 the medieval Penrhyn Hall
                            was remodelled by Samuel Wyatt. For correspondence between Richard

                            was a professional army officer, who also held three different
                            parliamentary seats during his career, including that of the borough of
                            Newport in Cornwall between 1790 and 1796. He made several promotions
                            through the ranks, from brigadier-general (1762) to major-general
                            (1777), lieutenant-general (1782) and general (1796). During his career
                            he saw service at home, including the office of governor of Chester,
                            1776‚Äì96, as well as service abroad, notably in Gibraltar between 1793
                            and March 1795. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and the
                            Royal Society, and left a substantial number of manuscripts, including

                            he became a leading specialist in portrait prints, and his series of
                            facsimiles of rare early British portraits were highly valued by

                            study in London, where he was taught to engrave by Francis Bartolozzi,
                            with whom he stayed until 1774. Contemporaries mention his ‚Äòvanity‚Äô and

                            patron of the arts. He was son of the Whig politician and prime minister
                            Sir Robert Walpole, first earl of Orford, and held parliamentary seats
                            between 1741 and 1768. From 1746 he made his home in a small house at
                            Windsor, which he transformed into a 'little Gothic castle', under the
                            name of Strawberry Hill, adding new rooms, including a library, in 1754.
                            His interest in portraiture was sparked by his acquaintance, from 1743,
                            with George Vertue, and led to the publication of <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</hi> (2 vols., 1762; vol. 3, 1764),

                            and Oxford Universities, brought up by his mother in England, before
                            being sent to lodge with his unsavoury grandfather near St Andrews (also
                            Norman Macleod, 19th of Dunvegan, An droch dhuine, 1706-72) , who had
                            nearly bankrupted the family. In 1771 he returned to Skye with his
                            mother and sought to redress the crisis on his estates, earning the
                            popularity of his tenants and impressing visitors like Pennant (1772)
                            and Dr Johnson (1773). in 1775 married Mary Mackenzie and purchased an

                            Invernessshire. In 1791 he broke with Pitt and Dundas and became a

                            indebted. </note>

                        <note>Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat (1744-95): Skye
                            landowner, chief of the Macdonalds of Sleat having succeeded his brother
                            Sir James in 1766. In 1776 he was made Lord Macdonald in the Irish
                            Peerage. Educated at Eton, he served in the Coldstream Guards and
                            married Elizabeth Bosville of Gunthwaite in Yorkshire, implementing an
                            ambitious programme of improvement on his estates in Skye and North Uist
                            and raising the rents, thereby causing widespread emigration. Macdonald
                            hosted Johnson and Boswell at his house in Armadale in 1773, although
                            the visit was not a success. In his original journal, Boswell wrote that
                            he and Johnson were 'full of the old Highland spirit, and were
                            dissatisfied at hearing of racked rents and emigration; and finding a
                            chief not surrounded by his clan'. They satirically dubbed him 'Sir
                            Sawney'. Although Boswell expunged most of his more offensive remarks
                            from his published Tour, Sir Alexander wrote him an offensive letter in
                            November 1785 which nearly led to a duel between the two men.

                            (1714-86), m. Jane McQueen, fathered 10 daughters and 3 sons.
                            Entertained Johnson and Boswell in Sept 1773. Of Raasay Johnson said
                            'This is truly the patriarchal life. This is what we came to find'. [TH,
                            p. 154] Macleod corresponded with Boswell and Johnson over the latter's
                            claim that he acknowledged Maclean of Dunvegan as his Chief: in fact,
                            the Macleods of Raasay were a different branch of the clan, which
                            Johnson acknowledged in a letter to the Edinburgh press, and corrected
                            in subsquent editions. Raasay was pleased and later dined with Johnson
                            in London. </note>

                        <note>Archibald James Edward Douglas [formerly Stewart], Baron Douglas
                            (1748-1827) was born in Paris to Sir John Stewart of Grandtully and Lady
                            Jane Douglas. He was nephew and heir of Archibald Douglas, duke of
                            Douglas and thus to the Douglas estates which had passed to the seventh
                            duke of Hamilton. Douglas's successful litigation against the duke of
                            Hamilton in pursuit of his inheritance became known as the Douglas
                            Cause, and became one of the most famous legal affairs of the eighteenth
                            century, enjoying massive popular support in Scotland. Douglas later
                            became MP for Forfarshire, and suffered financial losses in the collapse
                            of the Douglas-Heron of Ayr bank in 1772. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

                        <note>Mary Stewart, queen of Scots
                            (1542‚Äì1587), was born in Linlithgow Palace to James V of Scotland and
                            Mary of Guise. As a condition of French military aid against the
                            English, Mary was sent to France in 1548 to be betrothed to the dauphin,
                            later Fran√ßois II. She lived with the French royal family for thirteen
                            years, and was married to Fran√ßois in 1558, two years before his death.
                            Mary returned to Scotland in 1561, where, as a Catholic of predominantly
                            French upbringing, she faced resistance from the newly protestant
                            establishment. In neighbouring England, tensions arose around Mary's
                            apparent position as successor to Elizabeth, and efforts were made to
                            prevent her from strengthening her dynastic claim through marriage. She
                            eventually married Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, another claimant to the
                            English crown, who was murdered by unknown hands in 1567. Mary was
                            subsequently abducted by the earl of Bothwell whom she then married. The
                            marriage worsened Mary's standing among an already restless Scottish
                            nobility, who forced Bothwell into exile and imprisoned Mary in
                            Lochleven Castle, where she was forced to abdicate. Mary escaped in 1568
                            but the forces of her supporters were defeated at the Battle of Langside
                            and she fled to England, where she was again imprisoned until her
                            execution for treason in 1587. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Tobias Smollett (1721‚Äì1771), author, born at
                            Dalquhurn, near Renton, Dunbartonshire. After studying medicine at
                            Glasgow University, Smollett was apprenticed as a surgeon but enlisted
                            as a surgeon's mate on board a man-of-war before completing his
                            apprenticeship. He served in the Caribbean against the Spanish, and his
                            experience of war may have informed his novel, <hi rend="italic">Roderick Random</hi>, as well
                            as his <hi rend="italic">Complete History of England</hi> (1757-8). Smollett subsequently
                            settled in London where he authored several major novels, distinguished
                            by their often satirical or sceptical view of contemporary manners and
                            human character: <hi rend="italic">Roderick Random</hi> (1748), <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Peregrine
                            Pickle</hi> (1751) and <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand Count Fathom</hi> (1753). Smollett's <hi rend="italic">Complete
                            History of England</hi> (1757-8) cemented his reputation as one of the
                            preeminent writers of the age. Smollett's final novel <hi rend="italic">The Expedition of
                            Humphry Clinker</hi>, published shortly before his death in 1771, depicts the

                        <note>Robert MacGregor (bap. 1671, d.1734) was a
                            cattle farmer, outlaw and descendant of the proscribed Gregor clan,
                            known as Rob Roy due to his red hair. Rob later took his mother's maiden
                            name Campbell in response to the renewal of laws banning the name
                            MacGregor, and to curry favour with the Campbells of Breadalbane, to
                            whom he looked for protection from the Murrays of Atholl, whose cattle
                            he was in the practice of stealing. In the early 1700s Rob gradually
                            acquired modest property in the Trossachs and southern Highlands,
                            including the estates of Glengyle and Craigrostan. After enjoying
                            moderate success as a cattle raider and trader, he was denounced as a
                            bankrupt by his creditor, the marquess of Montrose and forced into
                            hiding. Rob Roy and his followers skirmished with goverment forces in
                            the wake of the Jacobite rising of 1715, and he was accordingly deemed a
                            traitor, pursued by Montrose whose estates he continued to raid, and who
                            retaliated through the construction of a garrison at Inversnaid. Rob Roy
                            was eventually pardoned after submitting to General George Wade in 1725,
                            who had been sent north to reach a settlement with the remaining rebels
                            of 1715. Rob Roy was celebrated by some in his own lifetime, but his
                            modern reputation (and his fame during the Romantic period and later
                            nineteenth century), largely rests on Walter Scott's fictionalised
                            account of his deeds in his novel Rob Roy (1817). <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            enjoyed enormous global popularity but the authenticity of which was
                            questioned, most famously by Dr Johnson. </note>

In 1785, William Thomson, a student at Oxford, wrote to the earl of Buchan, informing him that in 1782 he had seen the 'Quigrich', in the possession of one Malice Doire (Dewar), a day labourer from Killin, and inclosing a drawing. Thomson notes that Dewar's son, then nineteen, appeared to be mortally ill. In 1819, Archibald Dewar, then the heriditary keeper, emigrated to Ontario, taking both the crozier and Coigreach with him, although they were later returned to Scotland.

                            <note>Macbeth [Mac Bethad mac Findla√≠ch] (d. 1057) king of
                            Scots, and probable nephew of Malcom II. Initially the ruler of Moray,
                            he expanded his kingdom to incorporate more of Scotland, but was met
                            with resistance from his rival, Malcom Canmore (later Malcom III), who
                            in 1054, with Northumbrian backing, defeated him in a battle at
                            Dunsinane, and killed him three years later. Shakespeare's famous
                            Tragedy of Macbeth was based on the accounts of later chroniclers, such
                            as Hector Boece and Ralph Holinshed. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            and son of George, prince of Wales (later George II). Cumberland
                            commanded the Hanoverian troops at the Battle of Culloden on 16th April
                            1746, and subsequently oversaw the violent repression of the Jacobites
                            and their sympathisers in the Highlands. Cumberland's actions earned him
                            the sobriquet 'the Butcher', an association which contributed to his
                            unpopularity and hampered his political career. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>James Macpherson (1736‚Äì1796), a native Gael,
                            was born in Badenoch and witnessed the bloody termination of the
                            Jacobite Uprising as a boy. Educated at Aberdeen University, his ideas
                            of epic poetry were influenced by Thomas Blackwell. Encouraged by John
                            Home, he produced a number of poems translated from Gaelic, later
                            published as Fragments of Ancient Poetry (1760). Hugh Blair and other
                            members of the literati encouraged him to embark on a tour of the
                            Gaidhealtachd collecting Ossianic verse. The fruits of this tour were
                            published in the form of the 'translated' epics Fingal (1761) and Temora
                            (1763). Widely championed by Blair and the literati, they promoted
                            Scottish cultural nationalism and Gaelic culture at a time of low ebb
                            for both: Macpherson courted more controversy by dedicating Fingal to
                            the Marquis of Bute, the unpopular Scottish prime minister. Macpherson
                            was attacked by Irish, English and Welsh antiquarians and most notably
                            by Dr Johnson in his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775),
                            but the poems were enormously successful and effectively created a
                            popular taste for Highland tourism. Macpherson's subsequent career as a
                            historian, journalist, colonial administrator and politician (he became
                            MP for the rotten burgh of Camelford in 1780) made him a great deal of
                            money. He built a lavish mansion at Belleville near his birthplace in
                            Strathspey, and died unmarried in 1796. </note>

                            <note>Charles Edward (1720‚Äì1788),
                            born in Rome, was claimant to the thrones of England, Scotland and
                            Ireland. He landed at Eriskay on 23 July, accompanied by his close
                            supporters, 'the seven men of Moidart', instigating the Jacobite
                            uprising of 1745. Although Charles Edward had been unable to secure the
                            hoped-for level of military support from France, he was eventually
                            joined by the forces of several Highland chiefs. Marching south, the
                            Jacobite forces took Edinburgh on 17 September, while counter-attacking
                            Hanoverian forces under Cumberland and Wade assembled in the north of
                            England. The Jacobite advance on London was reversed after a council of
                            war at Derby, where many expressed their doubts at the army's ability to
                            take the capital. In early 1746, the Jacobites slowly retreated
                            northwards, despite a victory at Falkirk, and a final defeat by
                            government troops led by the duke of Cumberland took place at Culloden,
                            outside Inverness. Charles Edward fled westward with the help of
                            Jacobite loyalists, including the famous Flora MacDonald, and on 20
                            September left Lochaber on a French ship. While further Jacobite risings
                            were planned, none came to fruition, and Charles Edward died in exile in
                            at Rome. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>John Adair (ca 1650‚Äì1718) was a surveyor and cartographer of Scottish
                            counties in the late 1680s. He may have been the first Scottish
                            map-maker to make use of triangulation. Few of his maps reached
                            publication during his lifetime, with a selection being printed in the
                            1730s. While twelve of Adair's manuscript maps are still extant, the
                            rest were destroyed in a fire in 1811. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>;

                            Scarborough and later Cambridge, and commissioner for the revenues of
                            Ireland. He held prestigious administrative offices under the
                            governments of Walpole, Pelham, and Newcastle, reflecting his Whig
                            allegiances, despite a familial association with Jacobitism. After
                            succeeding to the Earldom of Kinnoul in 1758 he served as chancellor of
                            the University of St Andrews, funded local infrastructure projects, and
                            was elected president of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of

                            collaboration with Daniel Solander. He published important works on the
                            subject, including Natural History of the Corallines (1755) and the
                            posthumous Natural History of Zoophytes (1786). He later wrote on and
                            promoted the use of tropical plants in colonial agriculture, including
                            coffee and breadfruit, and was an early contributor to the study of
                            micro-organisms. He was a fellow of the Royal Society. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

                        <note>Daines Barrington (1727/8-1800) was an antiquarian, naturalist and
                            judge, born in Berkshire and educated at Queen's College, Oxford. He
                            held a number of high profile offices, including second justice of
                            Chester from 1778 and commisary-general of the stores at Gibraltar. His
                            first major publication was a work of legal history: Observations on the
                            Statutes, Chiefly the More Ancient (1766). He became a fellow of the
                            Society of Antiquaries and Royal Society in 1767. He contributed
                            twenty-four pieces to the Society of Antiquaries' journal Archaeologia,
                            beginning with a work on Welsh castles in 1770, and several papers on
                            natural history to the Philosophical Transactions, one of which formed
                            an appendix to a volume of Pennant's British Zoology. Barrington's
                            initially anonymous The Naturalist's Journal, published from 1767
                            attempted to record systematic observations of the natural world on the
                            basis of Baconian principles, and influenced the work of Gilbert White
                            of Selborne, to whom the Journal was transmitted by Pennant. At the
                            Royal Society Barrington was a proponent of the voyages of Phipps in
                            1773 and Cook in 1776, believing firmly in the existence of a navigable
                            Arctic passage. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            dominant leader in England during his reign. By 772 he had absorbed the
                            territories of lesser local kings in Sussex into his Mercian kingdom; by

                            river Wye in the south) may have aided these military ends, but also

Having sailed to his father's land in 1075, the year of the death of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, he secured the rule of Gwynedd, but was forced to retreat to Ireland following a battle against Trahaearn ap Caradog, king of Arwystli, at Bron-yr-erw near Clynnog. A successful attempt at regaining Gwynedd followed in 1081, but Gruffudd was soon after captured at Rug near Corwen and imprisoned at Chester for up to sixteen years, during which time the Normans made inroads into Gwynedd. In the last years of the eleventh century, he retreated once more to Ireland (1098), then returned to rule Anglesey (1099), his rule there this time sanctioned by the Normans. A tradition links Gruffudd with a statute relating to the eisteddfod held at Caerwys in 1523, perhaps based on a memory that he brought influential bards and musicians with him into Gwynedd from Ireland. <hi rend="italic">DWB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>The cartographer John Evans (1723‚Äì1795) was born at Llwyn-y-groes,
                            Llanymynech, on the Montgomeryshire-Shropshire border. His map of north
                            Wales on a scale of almost one inch to a mile and published in sheets in
                            1795, was a worthy precursor to the Ordnance Survey one-inch maps. A
                            smaller-scale edition was posthumously published in 1797. Pennant
                            recorded his indebtedness to John Evans for correcting a generally-held
                            misconception regarding 'Wat's ditch' near Holywell, in <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi>
                            (1778), I, pp. 21‚Äì2. He also noted here the latter's work on 'a large
                            map' of the area in question, a project 'extremely worthy of public
                            encouragement'. <hi rend="italic">DWB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>Jasper Tudor, duke of Bedford (c.1431‚Äì1495), the second son of Owen
                            Tudor and Catherine of Valois, and uncle to Henry VII. Henry VI granted
                            Jasper the constableship of the castles of Aberystwyth, Carmarthen, and
                            Carreg Cennen in 1457, but following the defeat and execution of his
                            father, Owen Tudor, at the battle of Mortimer's Cross in February 1461,
                            Jasper fled from Wales. He spent time periodically in Brittany, France
                            and Scotland, and made several abortive efforts at invading and
                            recapturing power in the name of the Lancastrian family during the
                            1460s, 70s and 80s, before the success of August 1485. Pennant notes
                            that Jasper was created earl of Pembroke in 1452; the title duke of
                            Bedford was created for him by his nephew, Henry VII, and awarded on 28
                            October 1485. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi> (1778), II, p. 257.</note>

                            was the son of a physician of the same name from Chester. Although he
                            qualified as a physician in 1757, his professional life appears to have
                            centred on the church, which he served as rector to several Essex
                            parishes near his home at Chelmsford from 1761 until his death. In 1771
                            he published <hi rend="italic">A Sketch of the materials for a new history of Cheshire, in

                            Pennant in 1770 lest it should frustrate Gower's progress with this
                            work. Correspondence between Pennant and Gower, dated 1770, c.1772,
                            1776, 1777 and 1778, suggests that Pennant benefitted from information
                            supplied by Gower, although he was clearly cautious regarding

In February 1780, she entered the Franciscan Convent of English Ladies at Bruges, where she remained until forced to leave in 1794 on account of upheavals connected to the French Revolution. She then moved to the Abbey House at Winchester, where she died. As a member of the Sarnesfield branch of the Monington family, Ann Teresa Monington would be a descendant of Hugh Monington II, son of Hugh Monington I, and brother to Sir Richard Monington of Lawton's Hope, Canon Pyon, Herefordshire. It was the latter who married one of the daughters of Owain Glyndwr, probably Sioned. Ann Teresa would not therefore be a direct descendant of Glyndwr, but a memory of him may have been kept in the related Sarnesfield branch of the Monington family, and could perhaps account for the information she had about his pedigree, according to Nash's letter. <hi rend="italic">Hereford Journal</hi>, 3 December 1794; 'Monumental inscriptions at Sarnesfield, County Hereford', <ref type="http" target="http://fmg.ac/phocadownload/userupload/scanned-sources/tgb/Vol12-PDFs/S-2244.pdf">here</ref> [accessed 13 May 2019]; Gruffydd Aled Williams, <hi rend="italic">Dyddiau Olaf Owain Glynd≈µr</hi> (Talybont, Ceredigion: Y Lolfa, 2015), p. 76.</note>

                            disputed the claims of his heroism made in the medieval Welsh
                            chronicles. By 1111 he was acknowledged as king of Powys. He left no

                            <note>John Luther (?1739‚Äì86), of Myles's, near Ongar, Essex, married Levinia
                            (n√©e Bennett) in 1762, but had left her by 1764. Educated at Trinity
                            College, Cambridge, and admitted to the Middle Temple in 1755, he was MP
                            for Essex from 1763 to 1784. Neither of Luther's two children survived
                            their father, and he bequeathed his Essex estate to a nephew and a large
                            Sussex estate to Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, with whom he had
                            had a thirty-year-long friendship and who had supported him at the time

                            <note>Josiah Wedgwood (1730‚Äì95) was born in Burslem, Staffordshire, to a
                            family with a long-standing association with the pottery trade. In 1766
                            he bought an estate of 350 acres near Newcastle under Lyme,
                            Staffordshire, where he built a pottery factory, calling it Etruria.
                            Strategically placed on the path of the planned Trent and Mersey Canal,
                            the factory (operated jointly by Wedgwood and Thomas Bentley) was
                            officially opened in June 1769, and became noted not only for its
                            innovative products but also for the enlightened treatment afforded to
                            its workers. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>Born in Anglesey, the botanist Hugh Davies was educated at the free
                            grammar school in Beaumaris and at Jesus College, Oxford. He returned to
                            work as a cleric on Anglesey, before being promoted rector of Llandegfan
                            with Beaumaris (1778‚Äì87) and subsequently of Aber in Caernarvonshire (a
                            post which he resigned in 1816, due to ill health). Pennant first met
                            Davies in July 1773; by the following August, Davies was accompanying
                            Pennant and his party on a tour of the Isle of Man and, in June 1775, he
                            returned there on Pennant's request 'to take a second review of its
                            vegetable productions'. Davies further served Pennant by contributing
                            information for a number of publications, and largely taking on the
                            mantle of editor for the reappearance of <hi rend="italic">Indian zoology</hi> in 1790. His own
                            direct contribution to the study of botany in Wales came with the

                        <note>Owen Tudor (c.1400‚Äì1461), the son of Maredudd ap Tudur ap Goronwy. His
                            father was descended from Ednyfed Fychan and held the seat of Penmynydd
                            in Anglesey. The circumstances of Owen's meeting with and subsequent
                            marriage to Catherine of Valois, widow of Henry V, is shrouded in
                            mystery and was the subject of much speculation by antiquarians and
                            chroniclers in the years following his death. Three sons were born of
                            the marriage, including Edmund Tudor, father of the future Henry VII.
                            Owen was captured at the battle of Mortimer's Cross in February 1461,
                            and beheaded at Hereford. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Catherine of Valois (1401‚Äì1437), youngest daughter of Charles VI of
                            France and Isabella of Bavaria. In an effort to bring about peace
                            between England and France, it was suggested as early as 1408 that she
                            should be a suitable bride to Henry V, but the marriage did not take
                            place until 1420. Henry's death only two years later left her as the
                            mother of the infant king Henry VI. Her attachment to Edmund Beaufort,
                            the young nephew of chancellor Bishop Henry Beaufort, was frustrated by
                            the enacting of a statute in parliament forbidding marriage to a queen
                            without royal consent. She later married (under morganatic terms) Owen
                            Tudor, although this was not known outside court circles until after her
                            death. Children from the marriage included Edmund and Jasper Tudor,
                            respectively father and uncle of the future Henry VII. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

He began a career in the army as a colonel in November 1780, and was active in Flanders during several campaigns alongside the Austrian army of the prince of Coburg in 1793‚Äì5. He later turned to military reform, but his reputation was compromised by his love of gambling and his ill-advised liaisons with women, especially Mary Anne Clarke.¬†<hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            Denbighshire, was a founder-member of the London-Welsh Gwyneddigion
                            society, a keen supporter of its eisteddfodau, and a poet with a turn
                            for satire. In his professional capacity as naval surgeon, he was
                            present on Captain James Cook's third voyage (1776‚Äì1780), an experience
                            which he documented in a detailed journal, later published as A

                            Islands (1786). Ill health and disillusionment with naval life led to

                        <note>Dr John Moore (1752-1820), was a physician
                            and author, educated at Glasgow University. After serving as a surgeon's
                            mate in the army, he attended William Hunter's lectures on anatomy at
                            London and later studied in Paris. He returned to practice in Scotland
                            where he attended the seventh duke of Hamilton before his death. He
                            subsequently accompanied the eighth duke as tutor on the grand tour of
                            the continent, later producing successful works based on his travels: A
                            View of Society and Manners in France, Switzerland, and Germany (1779)
                            and A View of Society and Manners in Italy (1781). His 1789 sentimental
                            novel Zeluco achieved widespread popularity and established his
                            reputation as an author of fiction. In 1792 he travelled to France where
                            he witnessed the growing violence of the French Revolution, recorded in
                            his journal during a residence in France from the beginning of August to
                            the middle of December 1792 (1793-94). <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.

                        <note>Henry Luttrell (1653/4‚Äì1717), served the Jacobite cause
                            in Ireland from March 1689, but had changed sides to support the
                            Williamites by October 1691. He was awarded the Luttrellstown family
                            estates as a reward, his elder brother having been outlawed as a
                            Jacobite. In 1704 Luttrell married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Jones of
                            Halkyn, Flintshire, with whom he had two sons. He was shot dead near his

                        <note>Thomas Percy (1729‚Äì1811) was a clergyman and ballad
                            collector. Percy's most famous work was his 1765 Reliques of ancient
                            English poetry. While some doubted the extent to which Percy's work
                            reflected a true ballad tradition (he heavily edited many of the pieces
                            in the collection), it was nonetheless hugely influential on Romantic
                            period writers such as Burns, Wordsworth and Scott. In addition to the
                            Reliques he published several other translations and collections of
                            supposedly antique literature, including Paul Henri Mallet's Northern

                            work, Scotorum historiae a prima gentis origine (Paris: 1527), which
                            narrates the history of the Scottish people from their antique origins
                            until the death of James I. Boece's Scotorum historiae was a major
                            source for the later works of George Buchanan and others. Scotorum
                            historiae was translated into Scots by John Bellenden, under the
                            commission of James V, to whom Boece's original was dedicated. William

                        <note>(Johann) Georg Adam Forster (1754‚Äì1794) was a Prussian traveller and
                            naturalist, son of (Johann) Reinhold Forster (1729-1798). Georg
                            accompanied his father on expeditions in Russian and later to London in
                            search of a position as a naturalist. In 1772, Georg and Reinhold
                            Forster joined James Cook's second circumnavigation aboard the
                            Resolution. Georg afterwards published a work on the plants of the
                            Pacific with his father, and A Voyage Round the World, in His Britannic
                            Majesty's Sloop, Resolution (1777). The German translation of the latter
                            was highly influential. In Britain, Forster's Voyage sparked a bitter
                            public dispute with the Earl of Sandwich, over the publishing rights to
                            Pacific journals. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>A native of Montgomeryshire, William Worthington (1704‚Äì1778) was
                            educated at both Oxford and Cambridge, and awarded the degrees of BD and
                            DD from Oxford in 1742. He subsequently took up a string of appointments
                            in the church in Shropshire, Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Flintshire
                            and Merionethshire, finally settling at Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant,
                            Montgomeryshire, in 1745. He was visited at his enlarged vicarage in
                            Llanrhaeadr by both Thomas Pennant and Samuel Johnson, and published
                            several theological works, including The Evidence of Christianity
                            (1769). His response to Hugh Farmer's 1775 Essay on Demoniacks was
                            published in 1777 and posthumously in 1779. His interest in missionary
                            work was reflected in his will, in which he left a legacy to the SPCK

                            of Pennant's mother, Arabella. During his time as a pupil at Fulham
                            school from 1740, Pennant suffered from smallpox and spent a period
                            convalescing at his uncle Mytton's home in Richmond. He also visited
                            Mytton's seat in Merionethshire during his boyhood and youth, and wrote
                            to the fossilist Da Costa in 1752 of his intention to use his time there
                            to gather specimens. A letter to Mytton describing an earthquake Pennant
                            had felt at his home in Downing in April 1750 became his first

                        <note>Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646‚Äì1723), born Gottfried Kniller at L√ºbeck in
                            north Germany, began his career as a history and portrait painter
                            working under the supervision of Rembrandt in Amsterdam. A desire to see
                            Van Dyck's works led him to London in 1676, where he worked in the
                            tradition of the latter and Peter Lely, becoming the foremost portrait
                            painter in England by the mid-1680s. His association with the court of
                            William and Mary resulted in his 'Hampton Court Beauties', painted at
                            the request of Queen Mary during 1690‚Äì1. He continued to be patronized
                            by royalty, working for Queen Anne and George I. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            Herefordshire began when Richard Knight (1659‚Äì1745) started to work its
                            furnace and forge in 1698. A partnership at Bringewood and Charlcotte in
                            Shropshire took control of the Bringewood forge until 1779, but the
                            family's charcoal-fired furnaces had all ceased working by 1785. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> s.v. Knight family.</note>

                        <note>Stafford Prys (1732‚Äì1784), whose father was doctor from a

                            Glamorganshire, began a career as a printer with an apprenticeship to
                            Thomas Durston of Shrewsbury in 1750. By 1758 he had launched his own
                            business in the same town. He printed a large number of Welsh material,

                        <note>Joshua Eddowes (1724‚Äì1811), the son of a grocer from Whitchurch,
                            Shropshire, began printing in partnership with John Cotton, c. 1749,
                            which was the year in which he was also admitted a freeman of the
                            Combrethren of Saddlers. The partnership lasted until 1765, Eddowes
                            continuing as printer on his own and subsequently in partnership with
                            his son. His work included an imprint of the classic Welsh prose text by

                            where he also notes that his correspondent was a younger brother of his
                            'worthy friend and ally Walter Scott esqr of Harden' and that he lived
                            abroad [probably in India] between 1755 and 1768. Evans, 'The life and

                        <note>David Hume (1711-1776) was a philosopher and historian,
                            educated at Edinburgh University and with strong intellectual
                            connections in Paris. Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature (1739-1740) was
                            a landmark of eighteenth-century moral philosophy which attempted to
                            place the study of the mind on the same empirical footing as the
                            physical sciences and thus establish a 'science of man'. The commercial
                            failure of the Treatise probably dettered Hume from attempting further
                            philosophical works of such length. While hugely influential, Hume's
                            sceptical empiricism was frequently attacked on religious grounds, and
                            his perceived atheism probably tharted his attempts to secure a
                            university chair in moral philosophy. Hume's most commercially
                            successful work was his multi-volume History of Great Britain (1754),
                            later re-titled The History of England. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            their father's printing business which was later buoyed by the presence
                            of the intellectual community around the Warrington circulating library
                            and dissenting Warrington Academy, the latter of which employed Eyres as
                            its official printer. Eyres established a national reputation as a
                            quality printer, producing works for Anna Laetitia Barbauld and William
                            Roscoe among others. Eyres printed several of Thomas Pennant's works,

                        <note>Alexander Gordon (c. 1692‚Äì1754?) was an antiquary and singer, educated
                            at Aberdeen University. He travelled in Italy where he performed as an
                            opera singer and toured classical and renaissance sites. On his return
                            to Scotland he pursued his antiquarian interests by researching Roman
                            remains in the country, attempting to trace the path of Agricola's
                            campaigns. Gordon's Itinerarium septentrionale (1726) became a standard
                            work for eighteenth-century antiquarians with an interest in Roman
                            Scotland. Gordon left Britain for Carolina in 1741, where he died some

                            in the Irish peerage) in 1735, in consideration of his putative descent
                            from David Duff, one of the ancient earls of Fife and recipient of lands
                            in Banffshire from Robert III. David Duff's existence was later disputed
                            by genealogists. Duff succeeded his cousin, (also William) Duff of Braco
                            in 1719 and was elected MP of Banffshire in 1727. William Duff was a

                            1751 he purchased the superiorities and church patronages of King's

                            Philosophical Society of Edinburgh. He is described as a friend by
                            George Paton in a letter of March 14 1778, in which Paton also mentions
                            that Bryce has visited Alexander Pope, minister of Reay in Caithness. On

                        <note>Samuel Varley (1744-1822) was a watchmaker, jeweller,
                            instrument maker, lecturer on natural sciences, and uncle to the
                            watercolour painters John and Cornelius Varley. In 1794 Samuel Varley
                            was one of the founders of the Chemical and Philosophical Society (a
                            forerunner of the Royal Instutition), and from 1800 he worked for the
                            radical peer Earl Stanhope at his country house, Chevening, in Kent,
                            where he acted as consultant to Stanhope‚Äôs scientific and technical
                            projects, among them the iron printing press and new uses for steam
                            propulsion. See Matthew L. Jones, Reckoning with Matter: Calculating

                            slavery and a prominent member of the burgh reform movement in the early
                            1790s. In 1785 Meliss married a Miss Stewart of Perth, and the following

                            Flodden. After a long rule by minority he attempted to consolidate his

                            Mary of Guise in 1538. James died in 1542 following a series of battles

                            His major works were The Minstrel (1771-1774), an influential account of
                            the growth of the poet's mind in Spenserian stanzas, and his Essay on
                            Truth (1770), which attacked the sceptical empiricism of David Hume on
                            religious and moral grounds. Beattie held the chair of moral philosophy
                            and logic at Marischal College, Aberdeen from 1760 until his death. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            (Edinburgh: 1791-1799), xv, p.530, records that one Mr William McAlpine,
                            a calico printer and son of a Glasgow clergymen, established a cotton
                            mill and print field on the banks of the Almond in the early 1780s. He
                            later expanded his concerns with a larger printing works in Scone, but
                            was ruined by his speculation on the Manchester cotton industry which
                            experienced a glut of the market. It is not clear whether McAlpine's
                            works are the same as those mentioned elsewhere in the Statistical

                        <note>Robert Sandeman (1718-1771), religious writer. Sandeman
                            was influenced by John Glas, and founded a church in London based on his
                            strict Protestant principles. Sandeman married Glas's daughter,
                            Katharine, and was a vigorous promoter of his religious views through
                            anonymous polemics published in the 1750s. Sandeman's commitment to
                            Glas's views was such that the sect eventually became synonymous with
                            him rather than its founder. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            Medieval chroniclers portrayed Macduff as a supporter of Malcom III

                            Antiquaries to create drawings and etchings. In work on plans and
                            drawings of English cathedrals Carter evolved as a pioneering recorder
                            of the Gothic style. An association with Richard Gough led to
                            involvement as a draughtsman for Gough's <hi rend="italic">Sepulchral

                        <note>Sir William Hamilton (1731-1803) was a diplomat and art
                            collector. He was appointed envoy to the Spanish court of Ferdinand IV
                            at Naples in 1764, where he established himself as a prominent collector
                            of Roman, Greek and Etruscan antiquities. Hamilton commissioned Baron
                            d'Hancarville's Antiquit√©s √©trusques, grecques et romaines (1766-67),
                            which was influential in establishing a taste for classical styles and
                            decoration among the elite of eighteenth-century Europe. Hamilton's own
                            collection of vases was purchased by the British Museum in 1772. The
                            post at Naples also allowed Hamilton to develop an interest in
                            volcanoes, and his observations and drawings were published in the
                            Philosophical Transactions and Campi phlegraei: Observations on the
                            Volcanoes of the Two Sicilies (1776). <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            philosopher from Samos and later Croton in southern Italy. Pythagoras
                            left no written work and thus many concepts may have been spuriously
                            associated with his name by later traditions. While Pythagoras is now
                            remembered primarily as a mathematician due to the theorem that has been
                            given his name, his association with geometry and cosmography is
                            probably a development of much later writers.

                            social convention.

                        <note>Robert Owen (1771‚Äì1858), socialist and manufacturer. Born
                            in Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Owen entered the textile trade at a young
                            age and quickly rose to the position of manager of a Manchester cotton
                            mill. In 1799 he married Caroline Dale, whose father David had
                            established the mills at New Lanark along with Richard Arkwright. Owen
                            became a part owner of the New Lanark venture, and he famously developed
                            Dale's philanthropic management of the mills into a socialist
                            manufacturing community, incorporating housing, schooling and
                            recreation. Owen's philosophy centred on his belief, expounded in his
                            New View of Society: or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the
                            Human Character (London: 1817), that an individual's character was a
                            product of their environment, and this was reflected in the 'Institution
                            Established for the Formation of Character' that he incorporated into
                            the community at New Lanark. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Horatio Nelson, Viscount Nelson (1758-1805) was a naval
                            commander during the American and French revolutionary wars. In 1785 he
                            married Frances Herbet Nisbet n√©e (Woolward; 1761‚Äì1831) daughter of a
                            judge on the island of Nevis in the West Indies. He commanded a squadron
                            against the French in the Mediterranean in 1795 and against the Spanish
                            in 1797. Nelson is chiefly remembered for major victories against the
                            French fleet at the battle of the Nile in 1798, and against the combined
                            French and Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, where he was mortally
                            wounded. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Joanna Baillie (1762-1851) was a playwright and poet,
                            born in Bothwell, Lanarkshire. In 1783 Baillie's brother, Matthew,
                            inherited the Windmill Street house of their uncle, the anatomist Dr
                            William Hunter, and Joanna, her sister and mother moved there to live
                            with him. In London, Baillie moved in literary circles and her poems and
                            plays met with encouragement from other writers. Her three volume series
                            of Plays on the Passions (1798-1812) presented dramatic studies of human
                            emotion and psychology, was widely read and pieces of it occassionally
                            staged, despite criticism that Baillie was a closet dramatist. Her 1810
                            play, The Family Legend was based on the history of the Macleans, and
                            was performed at Edinburgh with additions by Walter Scott and Henry
                            Mackenzie. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>Walter Scott (1771-1832) was a writer of narrative poetry
                            and historical fiction, whose Waverley novels (1818-1831) profoundly
                            shaped the Romantic period's conception of Scotland and its past, as
                            well as the literary marketplace. Scott was admitted into the Faculty of
                            Advocates in 1792 and held the post of sheriff of Selkirkshire from 1799
                            until his death. Scott's literary projects were informed by his strong
                            antiquarian, bibliographic and collecting interests, and his Minstrelsy
                            of the Scottish Borders (1802), based on materials gathered from oral
                            tradition followed in the footsteps of Percy's Reliques of Ancient
                            English Poetry (1765). Scott subsequently moved from editor to author,
                            writing several highly successful narrative poems based on historical
                            subjects, including The Lay of the Last Minstrel, Marmion, The Lady of
                            the Lake and The Lord of the Isles. Published in 1814, Scott's first
                            novel, Waverley, marked the begining of a decisive move from verse
                            romance to historical fiction, which saw him produce 32 novels before
                            his death. Scott's novels are marked by a distinctive combination of
                            narrative technique, historical research and enlightenment social
                            theory, that partly reflected the close-fought cultural politics of the
                            early nineteenth century.</note>

                            least two hundred elephants in opposition to the horses of the Greeks.

                            'Glorious Revolution' of 1688 he was moved to France with his mother and
                            placed under the protection of Louis XIV. The death of Queen Anne in

                            pursuing government forces, effectively destroying his support among the

                        <note>Jan Gossaert (c.1478-1532), was a renaissance
                            Flemish painter also referred to by his town of birth, Maubeuge. He was
                            probably in the service of Philip, Bastard of Burgundy, both on missions
                            to Rome and at his court and household at Brussels and Souburg. Gossaert
                            frequently painted figures of myth and antiquity, however Thomas
                            Pennant's attribution to him of a series of paintings on the life of
                            Hercules displayed at Holyrood Palace may be unreliable. See:

                            Grange (bap. 1679, d. 1745) was born in Edinburgh and married James
                            Erskine (bap. 1679, d. 1754), a lord of session and MP. The marriage was
                            unhappy, and when Lady Grange threatened to out her husband as a
                            Jacobite, he enlisted the help of Lord Lovat and Norman MacLeod of
                            Dunvegan to abduct her. She was initially held in Stirlingshire, before
                            being taken to Hesker, off North Uist, and eventually to the island of
                            Hirta in the remote archipelago of St Kilda. Rachel managed to inform
                            her cousin of her situation, but by the time help arrived, Norman
                            MacLeod had moved her again, to Assynt and then Skye, where she was
                            effectively abandoned. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>John Campbell (1634-1717), first earl of Breadalbane and Holland. He was born to the powerful Campbell of Glenorchy family, and a descendant of the feared Donnachadh Dubh. Despite taking arms against the royalists, John retained his title at the Restoration, and continued to ambitiously expand his estates, taking on large debts in doing so; a combination of scheming and bribery saw him take the title of earl of Caithness and Lord St Clair of Berriedale and Glenorchie. After the invasion of William of Orange in 1688, Campbell was involved in a number of Jacobite intrigues but his commitment to the cause was distrusted by his contemporaries: in point of fact, Campbell also had secret plans for a militia to support William in the Highlands, and built a barracks at Kilchurn Castle to house them. Following the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Campbell convened a meeting of Jacobite nobles at Kilchurn, and raised a small force of rebels. Kilchurn was subsequently captured by the government and Campbell died under house arrest at Taymouth in 1717. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>William Hunter (1718-1783) was born in East Kilbride and educated at Glasgow University, though he left without a degree. Hunter studied midwifery in London under Dr William Smellie, an associate of the physician William Cullen, and during this time became assistant to the anatomist and physician James Douglas. Hunter continued his medical education in Leiden and Paris before returning to London, where he found fame as a lecturer in anatomy. At the same time, Hunter's reputation as a medical practitioner and writer continued to grow, and he was appointed Physician Extraordinary to Queen Charlotte. Throughout his career in London, Hunter maintained stronged links with the Scottish Enlightenment literati; he was also an avid collector, and on his death he left his collections and library to the College of Glasgow, along with a substantial endowment for the construction of a museum to house them. The Hunterian Museum was founded in 1807. <ref type="http" target="https://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/about/history/drwilliamhunter">University of Glasgow, The Hunterian</ref>.</note>

Born in Anstruther and educated at St Andrews, Chalmers rose to prominence as a preacher in Glasgow in the late 1810s and early 1820s. An admirer of Thomas Malthus, Chalmers attempted to eliminate poor relief in his urban parish by establishing a system of charitable contribution and moral reform, which later formed the basis of his <hi rend="italic">The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns</hi>, 3 vols (Glasgow, 1821-26). Chalmers was also popular for his sermons on astronomy. He was later instrumental in the so-called Great Disruption of 1843, which split the moderate and evangelical factions of the Kirk, and led to the founding of the Free Church of Scotland.</note>

His governorship was short-lived and controversial due to financial issues and tensions between former convicts and voluntary immigrants, the latter of whom were to be favoured in land grants according to recent changes in British policy. After being shipwrecked returning from Jamaica in 1798, Brisbane developed an interest in navigation and astronomy, building an observatory on the family estate near Largs. He added his wife's name, Makdougall, to his own on their marriage in 1819. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

The son of a tenant farmer in Ayrshire, Burns's <hi rend="italic">Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</hi>, was printed by subscription in the town of Kilmarnock in 1786 and swiftly established its author as one of the foremost literary figures in Scotland, allowing him to abandon plans to take up a post in a Jamacian slave plantation. A second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> was printed at Edinburgh in 1787, where Burns was f√™ted by the nation's literati. Burns was a major influence on both his Scottish contemporaries and British Romanticism more broadly, partly due to his sophisticated use of dialect. Burns was also an important collector and editor of traditional song. After his death he was quickly elevated to the status of national bard, and widely commemorated and imitated, despite doubts raised by his posthumous biographers surrounding alcoholism.</note>

                            <note>The marine painter Nicholas Pocock (1740‚Äì1821) began his career in the employment of a Bristol maritime merchants' company, but started to work as a painter from 1778. His involvement with the sea continued and he became a well-respected painter of naval action, aided in some cases by his on-board presence during battles (as in the case of the battle of the Glorious First of June, 1794). Nine watercolours by Pocock, dated 1792, are included in vol. I of Pennant's extra-illustrated 'Outlines of the Globe' at the National Maritime Museum (NMM MS P/16/1). <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Evans,'The life and work of Thomas Pennant', pp. 617, 623.

Macdonald replaced his father as Chamberlain of the Macdonald's Trotternish land in 1765. In 1775 Allan and Flora emigrated to America, where he served in the British army, was captured and imprisoned in Novia Scotia. After his release, he and his family returned to Scotland, first to North Uist, before returning to Kingsburgh on Skye. In 22nd-23rd July 1773, played host to Pennant 'Mr MacDonald did me the favour or presenting me with three very curious pieces of antiquity: an urn, a glain naidr, or serpent-bead, and a denarius, found not remote from his house...Am lodged this night in the same bed that formerly recieved the unfortunate Charles Stuart'. Johnson and Boswell staid the following year, the latter describing Macdonald as 'completely the figure of a gallant Highlander'.</note>

                        <note>Charles Mackinnon of Strathaird, the 'Laird of Mackinnon' (c.1752-96). Boswell, who met him on Raasay on 9th Sept 1773, described him as 'a man of small size, delicate constitution, feebleness of voice and nearness of sight, but I was told had great knowledge, and hurt himself by too much study, particularly of infidel metaphysics...It was strangely offensive to hear infidelity from a Highland chief. It was like finding him toupe'd and essenced like a French fop'. His Observations on the Wealth and Force of Nations appeared in 1781-4. Married Alexandra Macleod, had three children, but separated in 1790. In 1790 sold Strathaird and died in poverty at Dalkeith. (Black, <hi rend="italic">To the Hebrides</hi>, p. 501).</note>

                        <note>John Clerk of Eldin (1728-1812) was a naval writer and etcher, son of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. Clerk studied medicine though never completed his degree, and was an associate of Scottish-Enlightenment figures such as Adam Smith and David Hume. Clerk was interested in naval tactics, which he studied through reports and model re-enactments, leading to the publication of <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Naval Tactics</hi> in 1790. Clerk was also an accomplished amateur artist, and had studied sketching under Paul Sandby. Clerk produced numerous topographical etchings of Scottish scenery, which he sold privately at Edinburgh. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

He is named by William Owen Pughe as 'Revd Ll. LLoyd of Caerwys, Flintshire, in 1798, although there is no reason to suppose that he was rector of Caerwys at that time or any other. Richard Fenton, who met him on a visit to Caerwys in 1808, described Lloyd simply as a 'clergyman'; but by 1811 he had become rector of Nannerch, a post which he held until his death. His Welsh cultural interests are displayed by his connection with the Gwyneddigion society, his subscription to Welsh publications and involvement in promoting the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales</hi>, and his work as an eisteddfod adjudicator.

Involved in securing circulating schools for his parishioners, he was also a keen antiquarian: three volumes of his antiquarian researches are held at the National Library of Wales. He was acknowledged in the Preface to <hi rend="italic">British Zoology</hi> (2nd edn., 1768‚Äì80), I, p. iix [sic; recte xii], among those who contributed 'kind informations' to Pennant for the production of the book.

There he met Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington and fourth earl of Cork, with whose household at Burlington House, Piccadilly, he became closely involved after his return to England. From 1720, he worked on the ornamentation of the house in an Italianate style, and he became drawing master to Burlington's wife, Lady Dorothy Savile. Led by Burlington's interests, Kent began work as an architect around 1730, designing temples, obelisks, and garden buildings. He worked at times in collaboration with the former, creating designs for the Painted Chamber at Westminster, for instance. Later work showed Kent disentangling himself from Burlington's influence as architect, as in the designs for screens at Westminster Hall and Gloucester Cathedral (1739 and 1741), which were Gothic in style. His work as a gardener owed less to his Italian experience than to study of published work on ancient Roman gardens on his return to England, or to observation of the transformation of Roman templescapes by figures such as Vanbrugh and Hawsksmoor at Castle Howard.¬†<hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>Born in the parish of Llanfihangel-y-Pennant in Merioneth, William Owen Pughe (1759‚Äì1835) moved to London in 1776. In 1783 he became a member of the Gwyneddigion society and began collecting material for a Welsh-English dictionary, the first section of which appeared in 1793. Pughe had, in the meantime, contributed to the cultural and scholarly programme of the Gwyneddigion as co-editor, with Owen Jones (Owain Myfyr) of the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym (1789), a work followed by an edition (with translation) of the poetry of Llywarch Hen, <hi rend="italic">The Heroic Elegies and other Pieces of Llywar√ß Hen</hi> (1792), and the three-volume <hi rend="italic">Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales</hi> (1801, 1807). Ridiculed by some contemporaries as a follower (from 1803) of the religious fanatic Joanna Southcott, and castigated by later scholarship for his innovations to Welsh orthography, Pughe was nonetheless generally well-respected as an antiquary and lexicographer during his lifetime. He assumed the surname Pughe upon inheriting a Denbighshire estate in 1806. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; Glenda Carr, <hi rend="italic">William Owen Pughe </hi> (Caerdydd: Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru, 1983). </note>

                            <note>John Williams (1727‚Äì98), born in Lampeter, Cardiganshire, was appointed minister of the Independent chapel of Sydenham in 1767, where he remained until the expiry of the lease on the building in 1794 or 1795. During his tenure of this post he was simultaneously involved as curator of the Dr Daniel Williams Library in Red Cross Street, London, an important post for dissenters in the capital since its establishment in 1729. His fascination with the Madoc myth and the possibility that Welsh Indians resided in North America was expounded in <hi rend="italic">An inquiry into the truth of the tradition, concerning the Discovery of America, By Prince Madog ab Owen Gwynedd, about the year, 1170</hi> (London: printed by J.

                        <note>The antiquary Roger Dodsworth (bap. 1585, d. 1654) was a native of Yorkshire. His antiquarian researches started within that county and centred, in the first instance, on records at the York Minster archives and on the pedigrees of local families, before extending to consider churches throughout the county. By the mid-1630s Dodsworth had begun to collect material on the monasteries of England more generally, an aspiration which resulted in the creation of a manuscript volume entitled 'Monasticon Anglicanum', which was published after his death as the joint creation of Dodsworth and William Dugdale (3 vols., 1655, 1661, 1673, with Dugdale the sole author of the third volume). Dodsworth later scaled down his project on an all-England study to work on a 'Monasticum boreale', centred on monasteries in the north of England. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                            <note>Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) was an English botanist, whose early work on mosses was encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks, Sir James Edward Smith and Dawson Turner. Hooker was elected to the Linnean Society of London in 1806. In 1809 he travelled to Iceland but lost most of his work in a fire during the return voyage. He was later professor of botany at the University of Glasgow. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

                        <note>David Thomas (Dafydd Ddu Eryri, 1759-1822) was born at Waunfawr in Caernarfonshire, and began life as a weaver before becoming a schoolmaster and teaching across north Wales. He had learned the art of Welsh poetry from Abraham Ellis, and set up a network of local poets known as 'Cywion Dafydd Ddu' (Dafydd Ddu's Chicks). He corresponded with the London Welsh Societies and won prizes at their eisteddfodau. He drowned in 1822, crossing a ford over the River Cegin.

The claim by Geoffrey of Monmouth and English chroniclers that she was the daughter of a British prince has led to her conflation with 'Elen Lluydawc' ('Elen of the Hosts'), who appears in the Welsh medieval legend  'Macsen Wledig' as the wife of Magnus Maximus (fourth century ruler of Britain).   </note>

                            <note>Born Marie-Jeanne Phlipon (1754-1793), she was a key player in the Girondin faction in the early years of the French Revolution. When her husband, Jean-Marie Roland de la Platiere became Minister of the Interior in 1792, she held considerable influence. Disliked by the more radical Jacobins and Montagnards, she was arrested at the beginning of the Terror in 1793 and executed in November that year. She wrote letters and memoirs while in prison, first in the Abbaie de St Germain des Pres, then in Sainte Pelagie, and finally the Conciergerie. A collection of these was published in 1795 under the title  Appel √† l‚Äôimpartiale post√©rit√© par la citoyenne Roland; an English translation 'An Appeal to Impartial Posterity' appeared the same year, with a second edition in 1796.</note>

Although Pennant did not meet her when touring in the 1780s, his description of her feats of hunting and rowing made her famous to a wide readership.

                            <note>Lord George Gordon (1751-1793) was a son of the third duke of Gordon, Cosmo George Gordon and Lady Catherine Gordon. He served in the navy, spent a short time in pre-revolutionary America and became MP for Ludgerhall, Wiltshire. Gordon is chiefly remembered for his leadership of the movement to repeal the Catholic Relief Act, which removed the penalties paid by some Roman Catholics for land purchases, and the so-called 'Gordon Riots' which ensued. Having agitated significant support for a petition to repeal the Act, in June 1780 Gordon was accompanied to Westminster by a crowd of around 60,000. The situation escalated into a violent riot which was only suppressed after several days by the deployment of troops. Gordon was imprisoned in the Tower of London and charged with high treason for his role in provoking the riots, of which he was acquitted thanks partly to the defence of his lawyers Thomas Erskine and Lloyd Kenyon. <hi rend="itlalic">ODNB</hi>.</note>

He hosted Johnson and Boswell on the island of Inchkenneth during their 1773 tour, and accompanied them to Iona; Boswell later succesfully represented him in a suit to regain part of his estates from the duke of Argyll in 1783. Prior to this, Maclean had no property of his own, holding only the tack of the Brolas estate from the Campbells of Argyll. Maclean commanded a company of militia against the Jacobites in 1745, and served in the Netherlands and Amerias. His wife Una, with whom he had three daughters, died in 1760.

                        <note>Joan, Lady of Wales (ca 1191‚Äì1237) was the natural daughter of King John of England (1166-1216), who married her to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn Fawr, Llywelyn the Great) in 1205. Often known by her Welsh name, Siwan, she is remembered for mediating between her husband and father, and for an affair with William de Braose, who was hanged by Llewelyn at Abergwyngregyn in 1230. (Pennant tells this story, as did Saunders Lewis in his verse drama, Siwan (1956)). The stone coffin traditionally thought to be hers was moved by Lord Bulkeley into the Church of St Mary and St Nicholas in Beaumaris, in 1808</note>
