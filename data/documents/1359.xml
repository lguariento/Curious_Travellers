                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute></opener>
                
                <p>In the course of long absences, I cannot do without a scribling word with you; and indeed there are no materials here, to give occasion to many: I have scarce seen anyone this month past, that is new, or that bringeth
                    news to me; The <persName ref="pe0426">Dean of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Asaph</persName> indeed, and 
                    <persName ref="pe2103">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Shipley</persName>, and our 
                    <persName ref="pe2104">Rector of Llansannan</persName>, and his Family, dined here in the beginning of the Week: His Deanship appeared to 
                    me, in good spirits; He has certainly Political Courage; and the Sense of Injuries, 
                    (and surely in some parts of his Case, he has been injuriously treated) will raise rather than 
                depress the Party so injured:<note type="editorial">Yorke goes on to discuss the controversy surrounding the republication by William Davies Shipley 
                of a reformist political pamphlet by William Jones, published annonymously by the Society for Constitutional Information. Shipley, as chairman, read the pamphlet before the Flintshire Association 
                and Correspondence (for parliamentary reform) in January 1783 and, when this action was criticized, arranged for its publication. This led to angry reaction from the high sheriff 
                of the county, Thomas Fitzmaurice, who had Shipley indicted for the publication of a seditious libel. A hearing at the Denbighshire grand sessions in September
                was postponed and the case removed to the king's bench in March 1784. It was finally decided in favour of Shipley at the Shrewsbury assizes in August 1784. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.
                </note> But I must 
                not launch into this great Gulph of Provincial Politicks, which 
                has suited almost every man's <del><gap unit="words" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del> size of Abilities, to range in: I find that 
                    <persName ref="pe0388">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erskine</persName> detaches himself from the <hi rend="underline">Coffee</hi>=<hi rend="underline">House</hi> 
                    Legislators, and comes down next Great Session to <placeName ref="pl1246">Ruthin</placeName>, on his own proper Grace, and Cost, to support 
                    <persName ref="pe0426">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Dean</persName>: Truly, I shall be sorry (as I said to you, heretofore) if that 
                Cause is in future to pass through more than common 
                forms; If it is yet meant to be fully debated, it will be the source 
                I fear, of many unpleasant things yet to come, and will 
                revive a very silly <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0704">Pamphlet</title></bibl>, which as it happens, seems to have diffused no Poison, 
                    and which, I really believe the <persName ref="pe0426">Dean</persName> 
                republished with no evil Will, or Intent whatsoever, but from the high and imprudent Spirit of the moment, 
                stimulated by debate, and Contradiction: I do now 
                understand, that <persName ref="pe0391">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. F:</persName> and his <persName ref="pe1263">Lady</persName>, in his name, 
                disclaim the Prosecution; But can the world give him credit, 
                so long,<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del> as it still proceeds in the name of <persName ref="pe2105">Jones</persName>; a name so immediately, and 
                    so inferiorly attached to him; and whose private and public Interest should personally disengage him <add place="above">(<persName ref="pe2105">Jones</persName>)</add> from such 
                    Actions: In my thought, if <persName ref="pe0391">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. F:</persName> would wish to apear manly, and Candid, let him 
                    openly avow his present Retension, and leave <persName ref="pe2105">Jones</persName> to act in the thing, propria mente, &amp;
                    in propria Persona;<note type="editorial">'correctly and his own person'.</note> and in the Event of so doing, I think, we should be rid of this disagreeable 
                    business. <persName ref="pe2106">Di:</persName> is very well, and desires to be very kindly remember'd to you, &amp; <persName ref="pe0238">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Pennant</persName>,

                    lately lost her Kinsman <persName ref="pe2107">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gestlin</persName>, as you may have heard: He was an honest man 
                    I Believe, and had a regard for her, tho I do not expect she will feel any marks of it, in his Will; for he took as I thought an unreasonable part 
                    in our affairs last Year, and because I could not suffer them to pass just as he wished, 
                    Refused to be a Trustee to the Settlement:<note type="editorial">Yorke's comments may refer to the marriage settlement relating to his union with Diana (n√©e Wynne), whom he married in 1782.</note> But this Entre nous.<note type="editorial">'Between ourselves.'</note> Repay me in Kind, and
