                <p>I send with shame as much of my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0268">Tour from London to Dover</title></bibl> that my 
                    <persName ref="pe0998">old secretary</persName> has done. He is grown I fear more than usually drunken; &amp; has brought 
                    his work very dirty. I hope it may be purified with the indian rubber. If not I would recommend you to get it again copied (<hi rend="underline">at home</hi>)
                    by one of the many exquisite writers you have in <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName>. y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> cost for this will not 
                    amount to 40 Sh. I hope you will like <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName>'s title page &amp; a bird on one of the margins.</p>
                <p>The little etchings of his are only Essays done many <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="7" reason="illegible"/></del> years ago.<note type="editorial">This probably refers to etchings discussed by Bull in <ref target="1117.xml">1117</ref>. 
                    See <rs type="art" ref="ar0176">etching of Mapleton Church near Ashbourn Derbyshire</rs> and <rs type="art" ref="ar0175">etching of Church of St Margaret's, near Lincoln Cathedral</rs>.</note>
                    you will find in the parcel two others: part of <rs type="art" ref="ar0187">Fountains abby</rs> better done. you will also find duplicates of relatives to 
                    <placeName ref="pl1701">Canterbury</placeName>, which you will want for the M.S. is there [?<unclear>cover</unclear>] to <rs type="art" ref="ar0188">flogging scene of Henry. II</rs>?
                    Did I send you at any time etchings of the <rs type="art" ref="ar0189">Am. birds</rs> by 
                    <persName ref="pe0014">M. Griffith</persName>. He can furnish you with many drawings for <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0012">Wales</title></bibl>;
                    but not for <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0039">London</title></bibl>, any. Pray send y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> list of the former.</p>
                <p>I think I have a set of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">Zool. part of the arctic Zoology</title></bibl> <note type="editorial">The 'Zoological part of the arctic Zoology' refers to the material following the 'Introduction of the Arctic World', evidently in the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi>, although the apparent reference to the incomplete condition of the work is surprising and may point to the early stages of printing the second edition.</note>
                    as far as printed for you. have you another; for we must not break a set. that work will become valuable for faintheartedly I printed but few.
                    <persName ref="pe0026">White</persName> must supply you with title pages.</p>
                <p>I have an attack of the gout in my left foot: but not on my head, spirits or hands: so I can write &amp; paste away most furiously.</p>
                <p>Pray let me know is <rs type="art" ref="ar0190">Andrea Doria</rs>, <rs type="art" ref="ar0191">Sebastian King of Portugal</rs>. 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0192">the Great Emanuel</rs>, any of the <rs type="art" ref="ar0193">Philips of spain</rs>

                    of the tribe. if you have health &amp; spirits pray examine &amp; favor me with the prices. Is there no dutch monfaucon <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0118">antiq. fr.</title></bibl> in any of the sales.</p>
                <p>my M.S.S. go on fast. one bound in vellum equals the <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName> binding done <hi rend="underline">in
                    <placeName ref="pl0731">Wales</placeName></hi>.<note type="editorial">The Welsh bookbinding work praised here was probably carried out by <persName ref="pe1520">Thomas Roden</persName>.</note></p>
                <p>I never heard of <persName ref="pe0428">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smiths</persName> pretty work till I saw it. a most malignant shaft was aimed at me by 
                    <persName ref="pe0417">Nichols the Mag. printer</persName> last summer: but my constitution was SO good as to repel the venom.</p>
