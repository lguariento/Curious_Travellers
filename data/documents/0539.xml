                <p>The Genealogy of the present <persName ref="">E. of Fife's</persName> Family is
                    claimed thus: Alexander Duff of Keithmore recorded in the Herald or Lyon Office
                    An. 1676, had a second Son William Duff of Dipple, afterwards of Braco, earl of
                    Fife's grandfather; upon the death of William Duff of Braco who had no Son, but
                    a daughter married first to Patrick Duff of Premnay &amp; now Lady of Alexander
                    Udny of Udny. This William Duff of Dipple as heir male &amp; of tailzie
                    succeeded his Nephew William of Braco had one Son William who in 1735 the 28
                    July was created an Irish Peer by the Title of Lord Braco of Kilbride as his
                    Letters patent bear, afterwards Earl of Fife of the same Kingdom, who was
                    succeeded by his second son <persName ref="">James present Earl of
                        Fife</persName>. This is is the Line claimed by the E. Fife but there are
                    some remarkable anecdotes relating to this Family, which have not been fully
                    ascertained to me, yet, so must crave your Indulgence for a few Post till I
                    procure more particulars especially about <hi rend="underline">William of
                        Dipple</hi>, whom you allude to. <gap reason="page torn" unit="lines" quantity="several"/></p>
