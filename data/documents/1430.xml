                <p>I received your Letter in due Time, and I should have acknowledged it sooner if I had been able to command sufficient Leisure to 
                    transcripte <persName ref="pe2135">Phayer</persName>'s Poem, which I have now the Pleasure to send you herewith.<note type="editorial">No enclosure survives with the manuscript 
                letter. The poem may possibly be a lament in the person of Owain Glyndwr sometimes identified with Thomas Phaer, and included in an edition of <hi rend="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</hi> (1578). If so, however, it would have appeared
                    posthumously, since Phaer died in 1560. See <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note> There are two Editions of it in the Bodleian Library. 1574 and 1587. I chose to Copy the first edition as it seemed to me to be 
                much more correct.</p>
               
                <p>I have sent you here with an Account of <placeName ref="pl3046">Hanmere Church</placeName> which <persName ref="pe2126">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price</persName> 
                    has desired me to transmit <del><gap reason="authorial" unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del>to you with his best Respects.<note type="editorial">For 
                    Pennant's account of St Chad's Church, Hanmer, see <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi> (1784), I, pp. 226–7. No reference is made to John Price's 
                    account there.</note> He informs 
                    me that he has a Description of <placeName ref="pl1788">Raglan Castle</placeName> &amp;c dat. 1674 which is very much at your Service.<note type="editorial">There 
                    is no evidence that Pennant visited Raglan in Monmouthshire, and no mention is made of it in either edition of <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales 1770 [1773]</hi>.</note> –
