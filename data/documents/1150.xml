                <p><persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> shall do all that is necessary: but he &amp; I are such bunglers at pasting that we did not dare to undertake it, so gave you the trouble. Many thanks for 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0335">Lord Cowper</rs>: the price is most acceptable though I risque the punishment of a postumous libeller, I must say it will perpetuate his insignificancy.</p>

                    I am at this time a good deal deranged in my plans by the long continuance of my good <persName ref="pe0237">sister</persName>'s 
                    illness. such is her hospitality &amp; her munificence: that I know we shall add to her weight of pain by being in 
                    <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName>; &amp; she incapable of receiving &amp; seeing us as she was wont to do. I cannot but in gratitude mention her kindness to

                    <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName> lessen. the Lady just mentiond is one. the enquiry after another school for my

                    is no small motive. to my journey. my friends fall off apace. one died last sunday: another is struck with a palsy &amp;
                    equally dead to the world. These things sink deep into me: and <sic>make wish</sic> my retreat as permanent as human duration will admit. I have all that conduces to ease. 
                    domestic happiness, increasing fortune; a disposition to contribute part at lest to the public good. <del>Sir R</del> To divert the subject:
                    <persName ref="pe0015">Sir R.M.</persName> leaves the country next week: so how shall I convey double letters to you: if such I have occasion to see. one of
