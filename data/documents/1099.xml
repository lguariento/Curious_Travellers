                <p>Perhaps I write unseasonably when you will have the noise of a thousand fiddles resting on your ears: but I must write
                    when I can: first to thank <sic>you many</sic> agreable minutes passed in <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName>: again for
                    your repeated munificence. I had a fine journey to <placeName ref="pl0001">this place</placeName>. The Prelate of

                    returned to my desk to prepare morsels for futurity. I have wrote my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0269">littoral journal of 1787</title></bibl>
                    as far as the borders of <placeName ref="pl1471"><sic>Hamshehire</sic></placeName>, which I must quit for a few weeks till I can get the great
