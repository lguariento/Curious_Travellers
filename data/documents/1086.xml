                <p>I received y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> late favor with the novelty of regret. I hope you wrote in one respect in the vapours; 
                    &amp; that by this time they are quite dispersed. drive them away by redoubled application to our elegant amusements. as to lameness, there can <sic>b</sic> 
                    no fancy in that. I doubt not but you will be soon restored by the most skilful hand <placeName ref="pl0777">Britain</placeName>
                can boast.</p>
                <p>I would not importune you so much about the New river, if an account was not essential to me:<note type="editorial">See <ref target="1083.xml">1083</ref>, n. 1.</note> Neither have I any other friend to trouble you on the subject. If not improper I wish you would be so good as to favor me so far as to give a line to the person who is possessed of the knowlege of that concern. I ask no secrets.</p>
                <p>I thank you for the hint about the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0068">mysterious mother</title></bibl>. &amp; 
                    shall think myself uncommonly obliged to you for getting a copy for me. Let me add another. <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0323">Granger</title></bibl>
                    says you have a <rs type="art" ref="ar1071">print of Sir Wolstan Dixie</rs> from the the painting in Christ church hospital.
                    Be so good as to get y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> cheap artist to copy the print;<note type="editorial">Bull's 'cheap artist' has not been identified.</note> 
                    &amp; it shall be allowed in our acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.</p>
                <p>my suit is ended with the <placeName ref="pl0002">chester</placeName> coach. the defendant offered to pay in court the 5<hi rend="superscript">£</hi>
                    he <hi rend="underline">gave a receit for</hi>, &amp; also costs. my attorney advised me to accept it which I have done.<note type="editorial">This appears to be a reference to a court case instigated by Pennant against the Chester coach, presumably for a loss of property in transit between Chester and London.</note>
                    You have therefore in my hands 2<hi rend="superscript">£</hi>. 10<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.
                    being equal to half the loss &amp; that I shall account to you for. I have a very trifle to do abo<hi rend="underline">ut <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0039">London</title></bibl></hi> &amp;
                    hope <persName ref="pe0111">m<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughs</persName> will by this time have begun to print it.<note type="editorial">When Pennant's <hi rend="italic">Of London</hi> appeared in 1790, its printer was Robert Faulder, not Henry Hughs.</note> This has been a work of vast labor. I smile to see that the magazines have taken the hint 
                    &amp; pour out their monthly engravings. In the last <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0420">Gent's</title></bibl> is a very good one of an old Chapel.<note type="editorial">Three engravings of churches were printed in <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman's Magazine</hi> in April and May 1789.

                    The scots did the same by my travels;<note type="editorial">Pennant refers to his Scottish tours: <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0001">A Tour in Scotland 1769</title></bibl> (1771), <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0008">A Tour in Scotland 1772, part I</title></bibl> (1774) and <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0010">A Tour in Scotland 1772, part II</title></bibl> (1776).</note>
                    for all their Prints histories, fisheries &amp;c &amp;c are in consequence of them.</p>
