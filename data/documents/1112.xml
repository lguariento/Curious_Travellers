                <p>I should have answer’d your last letter before this time, but I had no earlier opportunity to obey your commands in the manner I wish’d, respecting the pictures
                    &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>, of my neighbor <persName ref="pe0436">Sir Richard Worsley</persName>. 
                    I now send you a <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0065">rough lump of information</title></bibl>,
                    and if you think it worth while to lick any part of it, into form and shape, my little labor will not be lost; You may rest assur’d, that you are misled in nothing, and if it will be of the least use to your 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0269">Vectianum</title></bibl>, fruere et lætare.<note type="editorial">'enjoy and rejoice'.</note>
                    I shall use my interest to procure you <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0255">his intended book</title></bibl>, for we often talk of you, &amp; your works. 
                    He is of the most liberal disposition I have ever met with, and if the state of his finances will allow it, I dare believe, the book will be printed for the benefit of a few select friends, and not intended for publication, 
                    <hi rend="underline">but this is entre nous</hi>, for it will not be fair to anticipate his intentions.</p>
                <p><persName ref="pe0386">Sir George Cornwall</persName> has lately inform’d me that there is,, at his house in <placeName ref="pl1653">Herefordshire</placeName>,
                    a well authenticated original Picture of <rs type="art" ref="ar0168"><hi rend="underline">Lord Fanhope</hi></rs>, which was given to his father in law, 
                    <persName ref="pe1001">Walters Cornwall</persName>, by <persName ref="pe1002">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perry of <placeName ref="pl1654">Penshurst</placeName></persName>,
                    and of which he offers me a drawing, and a copy of which I, of course, offer you.</p>
                <p>We went from hence on Saturday, a large party, to spend the day with <persName ref="pe0992">Admiral Barrington</persName>,
                    and <persName ref="pe1003">Sir John Jarvis</persName> at <placeName ref="pl1637">Spithead</placeName>, where there is just now a 
                    noble fleet assembled, and seven flags Flying. they know nothing of their future destination, but as their orders are, to get 
                    in beer and water, and recruit all their Stores, and repair their top masts and rigging, which have suffer’d in their last 
                    cruise, so as to be ready for sea as soon as possible, they conclude, they are not to remain long unemploy’d. they saw no enemy,
                    and look’d into <placeName ref="pl1655">Brest</placeName>, where there was only one line of battle ships, so that there is nothing to be expected from 
                    <placeName ref="pl0925">france</placeName> this season, nor do they think much of <placeName ref="pl1474">Russia</placeName>,
                    and yet we are arming in every port at a great rate. the Commanders don’t seem contented, offended perhaps with the unusual 
                    Secrecy that is now observ’d in every department of the Marine – they don’t like being call’d out for nothing; they say we have 
                    no pretence to fall upon the <placeName ref="pl1202">Spaniards</placeName>, who are ready to grant every thing we ought to require, except a free trade in the 
                    <placeName ref="pl1656">South seas</placeName>, which was never yet demanded; – they don’t suppose the <placeName ref="pl1202">Spaniards</placeName>
                    will ever fight us, unless with alliances to make them more than our match, and that they are vulnerable in none of their ports or settlements, 
                    <add place="above">of consequence enough for</add> <del>worthy</del> the whole fleet of <placeName ref="pl0775">England</placeName>
                    being called out to attack. for my part I give <persName ref="pe0500">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt</persName> credit for good
                    luck, as well as great abilities, and I hope and trust he will find a way of getting out of <add place="above">the</add>
                    scrape which he has apparently got into.</p>
