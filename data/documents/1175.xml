                <p>Old men are apt to be peevish: but we must not quarrel. the ballance is in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> favor, 
                    so let <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>s eternally forget the past. At length I have found the long lost part of the arctic zoology,<note type="editorial">This is unlikely to refer to the volume of <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi> discussed by Bull in <ref target="1174.xml">1174</ref>, since that is touched upon later in this letter.</note>
                    which my son <persName ref="pe0421">Tom</persName> took up last week; Be pleased to send for it to <persName ref="pe0237">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pennant</persName>'s

                    I pity you for relinquishing any one amusement. I cannot follow y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> example but shall always keep something in hand to my last moment. 
                    our checks in the military operations, renders, it very necessary to re-animate our countrymen. for that purpose I have revived the bounties for 
                    <placeName ref="pl0702">Flintshire</placeName> seamen for so large a <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="several" reason="illegible"/></del>sum
                    was subscribed in this part of the county that much money remained in hand.
                    which it would be wrong to <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del> leave useless.<note type="editorial">Forty-six men from Flintshire joined the navy in 1793, and the bounty scheme was renewed for 1794. Evans, ‘The Flintshire Loyalist Association', 54–68, esp. 60.</note> you will call me an egotist 
                    (<hi rend="underline">I</hi>) but true it is that old <del>age</del> 68 sets most things in motion here. on mention of politics I must tell you that 
                    <persName ref="pe1742">Fletcher</persName> editor At <placeName ref="pl0002">Chester</placeName> of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0656">most virulent paper in Britain</title></bibl>
                    was this week seized &amp; is I hope by this time safe in <placeName ref="pl1629">Newgate</placeName>. a place not new to him.<note type="editorial">John Fletcher was the owner rather than the editor of the 
                        <hi rend="italic">Chester Chronicle</hi>. William Cowdroy took the role of editor on the paper from 1785. Löffler, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Welsh Responses to the French Revolution</hi>, pp. 137–71. No evidence has been found of the apprehension of Fletcher suggested here.</note></p>
                <p>
                    I thank you greatly for the <rs type="art" ref="ar0340">Godshill</rs> &amp; Newport Tombs.<note type="editorial">See <ref target="1174.xml">1174</ref> for a reference to 'two drawings of the Princess Elizabeth's

                <p>
                    I do believe that <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName> has not done a single article in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> quadruped part of

                    I am much obliged to you for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> kind congratulations on <persName ref="pe0065">my son</persName>'s nuptials. he brought home a
