                    &amp; yourself is the sincere wish of this house.</p>
                <p>
                    Your favor bore a most melancholy complection. The relation of the <placeName ref="pl1293">Birmingham</placeName> ass is
                    truely affecting but nothing to what happened within a short time past at <placeName ref="pl1251">Holywell</placeName>.
                    The rumour of a mob prevaling I mounted my steed, &amp; rode rashly into the midst of the market place. I scarce had time to 
                    speak but I was knocked off my horse dragged to a butchers blood, &amp; off went my head, before I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>

                    the Rascal, drown him the well. soone went I in, head &amp; tail, when wondrous to say, I had no sooner touched the 
                    holy hair of our blessed winefrid:<note type="editorial">Gwenfrewi or Winifred (fl. early 7th century) was closely associated with the cult of Beuno in north-east Wales.

                    but my viscera were restored &amp; my head as nicely united to my body as if nothing had happenâ€™d. I then sprung upon the bank. 
                    The ruffians took to their heels, &amp; by this miraculous intervention of our blessed Saint, Loyalty &amp; peace was restored to the country: 
                    I have been more than rewarded for my pain, having been unanimously chose chairman to the committee of the eleven associated

                    papers.<note type="editorial">The enclosures have not survived with the letter.</note> for the third, I fear I must wait another post. 
                    The welsh one is a translation of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0653">judge ashursts speech</title></bibl>.</p>

                    At length I have got <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> to set down to y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> work.
                    The subjects will not be so numerous as I thought: so I trust you will have them at the promised time. I still 
                    hold my pen. I saw it necessary to tack to <placeName ref="pl2515">China</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl2807">Japan</placeName>
                    for the sake of making both ends meet.<note type="editorial">Pennant's treatment of China was followed by attention to Japan in <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0462">volume XVII</title></bibl>
