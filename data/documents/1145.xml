                <p>many many happy returns of the season attend you &amp; yours. As for <del>we</del>us old men, quiet, innocent amusements 
                    &amp; increasing benevolences should be the sum of our prayers. I love to ease my friends: I will ease you by saying that I 
                    found two capitals impressions of the prints You want to complete the set of y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">arctic zoology</title></bibl>: they are indeed on small paper but of a 
                    paper so well adapted for coloring that they must please you. <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> will give them borders: you may then paste or let in as you chuse.</p>
                <p>my Philosophy was put to the tryal last night. <persName ref="pe0065">my son</persName> had ordered by a <placeName ref="pl2345">Rotterdam</placeName>
                    ship his collection of books &amp; prints made in part of <placeName ref="pl1472">Germany</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="pl1228">Holland</placeName>.
                    I had also 3 arms of Hock of the vintage of 1726 exactly my own age. a clerk from <placeName ref="pl0723">leverpool</placeName>
                    late at night was introduced to me to beg my assistance to save the goods of a <hi rend="underline">Rotterdamer</hi>
                    wreckd under <placeName ref="pl0001">my house</placeName>. I bore this with calmness: &amp; <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="several" reason="illegible"/></del>
                    this morning had my reward; for a post letter letter tells me, my treasures were safe in dock at <placeName ref="pl0723">Leverpool</placeName>.
                    I am sorry for the other’s loss of Gin, hides &amp; bull rushes which, magisterially, I shall endeavour to save. <hi rend="underline">We</hi>
                    have now only one ship at sea. from <placeName ref="pl2346">Venice</placeName>; with the other part of the German collection &amp; 
                    a small part of the italian. all the rest of the italian, a very great one is safe chez nous. <persName ref="pe0065">My young <add place="above">man</add></persName>
                    wishes to conclude with the northern courts: He will kiss the hands of the gentle <persName ref="pe0894">Catherine of Russia</persName>
                    next summer. &amp; then I hope he will do as his father did before him.</p>
                <p>In return for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> shipping accept a copy of a curious <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0077">natural history <add place="above">of quadrupeds,</add> with wooden plates</title></bibl> just publishd at <placeName ref="pl0057">Newcastle on Tyne</placeName>.
                    I will say nothing of the text for that is pirated from me &amp; others. If opportunity offers <del>offers</del> I will send it soon. if not will bring it with or about March 
                    1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. &amp; with it <hi rend="underline">your</hi> remainder of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0023">arctic zoology Ed. 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.</title></bibl>
                    which I had for you long since on large paper. <persName ref="pe0026">White</persName> with all his sharpnesses is far preferable to the puzzel-pated 
                    <persName ref="pe0328">Faulder</persName>. The coach I fear has a poor opinion of its customers to &amp; from <placeName ref="pl0731">wales</placeName>: for they always make us pay in advance.</p>
                <p><persName ref="pe0026">White</persName> is going to publish a most magnificent Edition of my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0036">hist: of quadrupeds</title></bibl>
                    with a set of entire new plates.</p>
                <p>I have made a very fine voyage <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0404">down the <placeName ref="pl2347">Ganges</placeName> from its fountain in the <placeName ref="pl2348">Kingdom of Thibet</placeName></title></bibl>:
                    I do think full as credible as <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0427">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bruces from the Fountains of the nile</title></bibl>.
                    mine I really believe may be depended for <hi rend="underline">my</hi> authorities:<note type="editorial">This comment may refer to the controversy over the assistance given Bruce by a secretary and draughtsman from Bologna, named Luigi Balugani. Balugani accompanied Bruce on the expedition, but the latter claimed that he had died before the journey was begun and made no acknowledgement of his contribution. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> s.n. James Bruce.</note>
                    you shall see the rich volume volume: but Do not burst with envy at the old fellow who has composed XIII. folios in five years.
                    <note type="editorial">The number and order of the volumes in 'Outlines of the Globe' were subject to change during the final years of Pennant's life, as comparison between the accounts of the work given in <hi rend="italic">Literary life</hi>, pp. 41–5, and in <hi rend="italic">HPWaH</hi>, pp. 318–22, demonstrates. The latter claims to describe the volumes 'according to their permanent state'. <hi rend="italic">HPWaH</hi>, p. 318.</note></p>
