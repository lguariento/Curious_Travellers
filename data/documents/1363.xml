                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute></opener>
                
                <p>I attempted with some pains and to little purpose, the several pedigrees of the different descendants of
                    <persName ref="pe0618">Bleddyn ap Cynfyn</persName>, the founder of our third Royal Tribe, but communications failing me, the design, 
                    hath ended, for the present at least, in this slight Memoir of the Princes and Lords of <placeName ref="pl1224">Powys</placeName>, 
                    only.<note type="editorial">This dedicatory letter, addressed to Pennant in recognition of Yorke's sense of the latter's huge contribution 
                        to the field of Welsh antiquarianism (see <ref target="1361.xml">1361</ref>), prefaces Yorke's 1795 publication, <hi rend="italic">The Tracts of Powys</hi>. 
                    The work focused on the descendants of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, provided notes on the crown lordships of Powys, and argued against the anti-Galfridian view of the 
                    origins of the ancient Britons expressed by Polydore Virgil. The <hi rend="italic">Tracts</hi> were expanded 
                        in <hi rend="italic">The Royal Tribes of Wales</hi>, published in 1799. See <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>; <hi rend="italic">DWB</hi>.</note> Such as it is then,
                    permit me to present it you, as to one, by whom 
                our Antiquities have been best understood, and best illustrated. I have added the names of all the families I can find descended 
                from this, as from the nineteen other Tribes: from that source alone, the information necessary must be sought; what we have abroad, 
                is without anecdote, imperfect and uninteresting, and I detach this
                with great submission among them, on a service of better intelligence: If with success, 
                I would report progress; for I am free to think the race of <persName ref="pe2108">Cadwalader</persName>, more glorious 
                    than the breed of <persName ref="pe2109">Gimcrack</persName>, and a Welsh Card, than a <placeName ref="pl3015">Newmarket</placeName> Calendar.</p>
