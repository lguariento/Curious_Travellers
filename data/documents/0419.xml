                <opener><salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
                <p>Your much esteem'd Favour of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April I
                    received in Course of Post. — As to your first Query, the number of Souls in
                        <placeName ref="pl0688">Lismore</placeName> alone is about 1500; but
                        <placeName ref="pl0688">Lismore</placeName> is but a Part of my Parish which
                    in whole exceeds 42 computed Miles in Length from the one Extremity to the other
                    with the Country of <placeName ref="pl2433">Glenco</placeName> included which is
                    a part of my Parish, besides 9 computed Miles upon the Continent of <placeName ref="pl2730">Kingerloch</placeName>. — Our Inhabitants are surely upon the
                    Decrease; they are so particularly upon the main Land because many of the Farms
                    are now occupied with Sheep &amp; more of them will soon be laid out in that way
                    — As to your 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> Query, we export no Corn or Grain
                    of any Kind; not even from this Island except a considerable Quantity of Bear,
                    which (as I hinted in my last to you) is distill'd into Spirits &amp; several
                    Hundred Bolls of that Commodity are yearly sold in the neighbouring Countries of
                        <placeName ref="pl2731">Lorn</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl0729">mull</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl2193">Appin</placeName>, <placeName ref="pl2243">Lochaber</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="pl2216">Ardgour</placeName> — There is an immense Quantity of Meal yearly imported
                    into most parts of <placeName ref="pl0818">Argyleshire</placeName>; even in the
                    Island they buy a great Quantity as most of the meal of the Island goes to pay
                    the Landlords — It has been computed that some years above <del rend="overstrike">above</del> thirty Thousand Bolls of Meal have been
                    imported to <placeName ref="pl0818">Argyleshire</placeName> from <placeName ref="pl0889">Ireland</placeName> &amp; the north of <placeName ref="pl0705">Scotland</placeName> —</p>
                <p>As to your third Query, its not very easy ascertaining the Number of black Cattle
                    annually sold off, as they are disposed off sometimes in year olds, sometimes in
                    two years olds, &amp; that not in parcels or Numbers, but one or two at a Time —
                    Perhaps there may be about a Hundred sold yearly from the Island; its difficult
                    to ascertain their Prices as they are of very different Qualities. Their
                    year-olds sell from fifteen to thirty Shillings each; Their two year-olds from
                    thirty to forty Shillings; their three year-olds from 40/ to three pounds &amp;
                    so on. — I am greatly obliged to you for the prints which seem to be extreamly
                    well <sic>execute</sic>. —</p>
                <p>There is a Society of Highland Clergymen, that have lately come to a Resolution
                    to write a Grammar &amp; Dictionary of the Galic Language; the Work is to be
                    immediately set about. —</p>
