                    tickets<note type="editorial">This may refer to the concerts and plays staged at the Wynnstay theatre, home of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, fourth baronet, although by the early 1780s Wynn had started to make economies, notably through the sale of his horses and hounds in 1781. <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</note>
                    which had escaped me. Pray never speak of the double carriage of a former Box. I will not suffer you to be a double 
                    Loser. I hope this will catch you before you leave <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName> for since I sent the sheets of 
                    England &amp; orkney,<note type="editorial">'England' and 'orkney' as referred to here are sections of Pennant's '<bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">Introduction of the Arctic World</title></bibl>', incorporated into 'Outlines of the Globe' in his own case, but also extra-illustrated by Bull.</note>
                    I stumbled on a forgotten treasure of drawings relative to the latter. Be pleased to return the sheets by sending them 
                    packed between paste board <del>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></del> to <persName ref="pe0111">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughs</persName>

                    <gap unit="letters" quantity="7" reason="illegible"/> but amendment. I hope to bring up both our sets in December, when we may 
                    bind them <del>together</del> after consulting on a more careful binder than <persName ref="pe0435">Wingrave</persName>
                    who almost spoiled for me <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0368">a fine set of <persName ref="pe0045">Cook</persName></title></bibl>.
                    Pray what has old <persName ref="pe0405">Kippis</persName> said of his life.</p>
                <p>Have I cleared up y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> doubts about the Padagons<note type="editorial">Pennant refers to his publication, <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0033">Of the Patagonians</title></bibl>, a copy of which he appears to have sent Bull with a letter of 15 April 1788.
