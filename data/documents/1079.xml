                    back it is owing to what I said a desire to make your copy as perfect as my own: for after the parcel was sent I found numbers of drawing 
                    relative to the <placeName ref="pl1476">Scottish isles</placeName>,<note type="editorial">For a 'List of Drawings made by Moses Griffith in my Tour to Scotland 1772. and of others presented to me on my journey', see one of three unnumbered notebooks in NLW 2530A. The second list within this notebook, headed 'Book No. II' includes numerous references to Scottish isles, including Bute, Arran, Y columbkil, Mull and <sic>Skie</sic>.</note>
                    which I had not thought of. if you send them at michaelmas I ca<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>n

                <p>I hope to meet you in <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName> in December; very early in the month. not to find a New Binder for 
                    <persName ref="pe0435">Wingrave</persName> is grown so negligent as almost to ruin for me my 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0368">set of <persName ref="pe0045">Cook</persName></title></bibl>. so rapidly have the arts travelled, that at 
                    <placeName ref="pl0002">Chester</placeName> I find one, and at <placeName ref="pl1477">Denbigh</placeName>. another whom I shall trust in preferrence 
                    to the workman of <placeName ref="pl1012">Fleetstreet</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Was it not for the sort of Education I mean to give <persName ref="pe0235">my <hi rend="underline">little</hi> girl</persName>,
                    I should be indifferent to <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName>: saving the sight of a few friends, among whom I need not name one. 
                    The above is a home Education: for I detest the unnatural one of schools. when a widower I was forced to send 
                    <persName ref="pe0234">my eldest</persName> to one. her mind was returned to me untainted: but her most elegant figure was shamefully injured.</p>
                <p>I thank you for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> politics. Be so good as to continue them; for I hear nothing but 
                    <del>the m</del>thro' the medium of news papers: &amp; what I see now respecting our domestic Jars frighten an old man, who dreads the return of faction 
                    &amp; sedition.</p>
                <p>The cruel shock of our Cotton trade affects my little town of <placeName ref="pl1251">Holy well</placeName>. The manufacturers there 
                    <hi rend="underline">do</hi> keep on their legs: but have discharged multitudes of their people. the works there were superior to those of any other part of the Kingdom; 
                    &amp; the most elegant. a foolish rapacity has brought about all this calamity.</p>
                <p>I fancy we shall soon hear of the <persName ref="pe0894">northern semiramis</persName> following <persName ref="pe1462">her Husband</persName>.</p>
