                <p>At <placeName ref="pl2443">Mostyn</placeName> is <rs type="art" ref="ar0367">Charles II</rs>. in the size of the inclosed on board surrounded with numbers of 
                    beauties of the same size.<note type="editorial">See <ref target="1183.xml">1183</ref>, where it becomes clear that Pennant is here referring to individual 
                        drawings of courtly ladies, such as the group of three-quarter length portraits by Sir Peter Lely, 'The Windsor Beauties', painted in the early 
                        1660s, and the 'Hampton Court Beauties' mentioned in this letter. Portraits of women currently at Mostyn Hall include one of Dorothy, Viscountess 
                        Andover, later Countess of Berkshire, after Anthony Van Dyck, and members of the Mostyn family, such as Essex Mostyn, Duchess of Roxburghe, by Thomas Hudson.</note>
                    they probably are reduced from larger pictures. Pray by whom &amp; by whom the originals. are the <rs type="art" ref="ar0320">beauties of Hampton <add place="above">Court</add></rs>: you perhaps can give me the list &amp; say who the inclosed is? Is there not a set of prints of them?</p>
