                <p>You have exceeded your habitual munificence &amp; furnished me with most valuable illustrations of my M.S.S. I fear you will find you have robbed 
                    y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>self of many <rs type="art" ref="ar0233">dutch Heroes</rs> whom you will find fighting in the

Else I shall return none.</p>
                <p>You over rate the value of my brains greatly: for they are the only consumption I am at the expence of.</p>
                <p>The <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0268">journal</title></bibl> must be re-copied. my <persName ref="pe0998">old sot</persName>

                    <persName ref="pe0404">Tom Jones my young secretary</persName> will I am sure give you full content &amp; that soon. He improves daily 
                    &amp; writes most delightfully.</p>
                <p>I have just had ½ a Ream of Green paper arrived so we can settle that article readily.</p>
                <p>A very odd M. S. was sent me last week respecting <rs type="art" ref="ar0285">the markets of London 1598</rs>.
