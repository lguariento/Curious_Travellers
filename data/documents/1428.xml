                    assigned to the several Degrees. Performers upon the Harp <del><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del> or Crwth<note type="editorial">'crowd'.</note> 
                    only were admitted, to these Honours, the inferior Performers as they are called, those who <hi rend="underline">played upon the Different Kinds of Flutes or pipes 
                    Tabors, or <del><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del>the three stringed crwth<note type="editorial">'crowd'.</note> or as it is 
                    otherwise called the Fiddle</hi> were allowed no honours, nor even to sit down while they played <sic>butt</sic> to play standing. The vocal Performers, 
                    graduates were of two sorts: of the first sort were the Bards, who were further subdivided into three classes: of the second were the singers answering 
                    to our modern vocal Performers. All these were required to do <sic>statuteable</sic> Exercises, as well as the Instrumental Performers for their several Degrees. None 
                    of the Performers of either Side could attain these Honours under twelve Years at least, I mean of Bards <del>of</del>or of primary Musicians. And 
                    in order to ma<del>y</del>ke them pay <del><gap reason="illegible" unit="letters" quantity="1"/></del>all possible Attention to their Studies no man was allowed 
                    to be of two Professions i.e. to study Poetry professedly, and to play upon the Harp or Crwth,<note type="editorial">'crowd'</note> nor suffered to be 
                    of any Trade or Profession whatsoever. but what he first assumed. The Laws may be seen at large in J David Rhese's <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0610">Grammar</title></bibl> pag. 295.
