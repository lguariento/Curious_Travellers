                <p>Among the various papers I received from the Clergy was one of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0588">the survey of the Highlands &amp; isles
                            in 1760 by order of the general assembly</title></bibl>.<note type="editorial">Prior to his tour of Scotland in 1772, Pennant solicited
                        local information through the publication of letters and questionnaires.
                        These <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0528">'Queries'</title></bibl>
                        appeared as an appendix to the first edition of Pennant's <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0001"><hi rend="italic">Tour in Scotland
                                    1769</hi></title> (1771)</bibl>, and were 'Addressed to the
                        Gentlemen and Clergy of North-Britain', pp.282-298. A note to Pennant's
                            <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0003"><hi rend="italic">Supplement
                                    to the Tour in Scotland</hi></title></bibl>, (1772), states
                        that: 'These queries were originally composed and printed by order of the
                        Society of Antiquarians, and dispersed thro’ several parts of England. As
                        the spirit of enquiry seems at present reviving, I took the liberty of
                        reprinting them, in hopes of their meeting with better success than they did
                        formerly; and that gentlemen may be induced, from them, either to form local
                        histories, or to transmit them to so respectable a society such matters
                        relating to the history of their country as will merit it’s attention.'
                        pp.17-18. The 'Queries' also appeared in the <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0188"><hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi></title> 34 (April
                            1772), 173-4</bibl>, accompanied by a letter (probably written by
                            <persName ref="pe0022">Robert Ramsay</persName>), which commended them
                        'to the curious in general, but more directly to the clergy of Scotland',
                        and attempted to curry favour by quoting Pennant's 'encomium upon the
                        established clergy of Scotland' in his <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0001"><hi rend="italic">Tour in Scotland 1769</hi></title>

                    the parishes to me; but unluckily it does not comprehend <placeName ref="pl0717">Ilay</placeName>, &amp; <placeName ref="pl0716">Jura</placeName> &amp; the
                    little isles dependent on them. neither does it take in <placeName ref="pl0897">Cantyre</placeName>, nor the isles of <placeName ref="pl0636">Giga</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="pl1187">Cara</placeName>:</p>
                <p>Probably somebody has surveyed those also, therefore permit me to trouble you
                    with obtaining the accounts of those parts as far as relates to the Parishes
                    places of worship in them, the boundaries, number of inhabitants. perhaps these
                    may be found in the <placeName ref="pl1188">office of the General
