                <p>I really agree with you in the propriety of sending down the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0269">M.S.</title></bibl> 
                    <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> can do the drawings much better on the margin than on loose papers. He shall alter the obscurity about the

                    I can give you <rs type="art" ref="ar0229">prints of some english birds</rs> which you may <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="4" reason="illegible"/></del>
                paste as you please.</p>
                <p>I am very much obliged to you for the accounts of the <placeName ref="pl1582">fo<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="2" reason="illegible"/></del>rests</placeName>:
                    but I still stick at <placeName ref="pl1989">Emsworth</placeName> for want of this new map of <placeName ref="pl1471">Hampshire</placeName>.<note type="editorial">The map awaited by Pennant was to be produced by <persName ref="pe0389">William Faden</persName>. See <ref target="1099.xml">1099</ref>.</note></p>
                <p>I thank you for the very curious bill of fare given by my catch penny pirate of <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName>.<note type="editorial">This enclosure has not survived with the manuscript letter.</note> it really diverts me much.</p>

                    Adm. &amp; captains mentioned or to be mentioned by me in the bloody fights of last century. I therefore ask for none of them: 
                    but I shall thank you much for <rs type="art" ref="ar0226">Heemskirk</rs> who fell before Gibraltar in 1607.</p>
                <p>Let me trouble you to send in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> parcel two dozen of the best black lead pencils, not very slenders ones. 
                    This you will say prognosticates a <placeName ref="pl0731">welsh</placeName> residence during this season: 
                    which it certainly does. I shall make it up next year by doubling my time.</p>

                <p>Inclosed are some more of the <persName ref="pe0009">Edinburgh barber</persName>'s work.
                    the <rs type="art" ref="ar0227">Tragedy Hero &amp; heroine</rs> are not amiss. If I send duplicates Pray present them to
