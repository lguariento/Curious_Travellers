                <p>It gives <persName ref="pe0014">Moses Griffith</persName> much concern to hear that he does not bestow equal pains on all his works which he declares he is not conscious of. 
                    He indeed made the large drawings larger than I could have wished, but has charged them only 9<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>
                    each, whereas his usual price is 12<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.
                    He likewise charges you at the rate he first began, as being an original c<supplied>us</supplied>tomer. Should you dislike any drawing he will 
                    <sic>chearfully</sic> take it back. your other orders will be most punctually obeyed. &amp; you may depend on having

                    I fear the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0032">journey to London</title></bibl> must crave <choice><abbr>y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></abbr><expan>your</expan></choice>

                <p>I am struck with horror at the loss of the royal George &amp; more so to find she really was so rotten as not fit to be trusted out of Port.<note type="editorial">HMS <hi rend="italic">Royal George</hi> sank in the harbour at Spithead on 28 August 1782 with the loss of more than 800 lives.

                    the loss must occasion much murmur: for our Fleet has lain two months idle. neither that fortress relieved, nor our important stores relased

                    But to <del>my</del>conclude my horrors, I tremble more at the profligacy of the common people; &amp; the cruel robberies which destroy all
