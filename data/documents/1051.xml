                <p>I was in hopes of hearing that you was confirmed in <placeName ref="pl0759">y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> town residence</placeName>
                    before this especially as I am now fixed on a short visit to <placeName ref="pl0699">the capital</placeName> next month.
                    your company will be no small comfort during my stay. <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> begs
                    y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> acceptance of the inclosed for p. 56<hi rend="superscript">X</hi>
                    of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0012">welsh Tour</title></bibl>. He is much vexed about the dirt on some of the pages; but hopes not to forfeit y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                    favor. I must inform you of a very disagreable disappointment he has experienced from a welsh squire of very considerable fortune<note type="editorial">The man in question has not been identified.</note>
                    who bespoke <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="7" reason="illegible"/></del> a <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0012">first volume of the welsh tour on large paper</title></bibl>
                    illuminated on the margins as your is with numbers of other drawings &amp; prints. 
                    This is a heavy loss to him. you will lay me under an obligation if you would recommend it to a purchaser. The poor man is much 
                    hurt by the dirty treatment he met with, as he had entered into a small business on the strength of the expectation. I annex in 
                    the P. S. the number of drawings, which will be charged as yours were.</p>
