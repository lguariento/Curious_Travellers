                <p>I was much affected with the account of poor <persName ref="pe0293">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burel</persName>. 
                    to hear of so heavy an affliction befalling a person I was making no unjust complaint of really touched my heart &amp;
                    softened it into the most perfect forgiveness.</p>
                <p>Take my word for it four out of the six parts of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0062">great Sussex map</title></bibl>
                    are engraven. I saw three or <sic>four four</sic> of them at <placeName ref="pl1385">Arundel Castle</placeName>. &amp; one or two no further
                    <del>off</del> from you than the <placeName ref="pl2184">Fountain at Portsmouth</placeName>.
                    they were done by <persName ref="pe0846">Yeakel</persName> &amp; <persName ref=" pe0847">Gardner</persName> under the patronage of the 
                    <persName ref="pe0407"><choice><abbr>D.</abbr><expan>Duke</expan></choice> of Richmond</persName>. I am not without hopes of getting them as I have applied to a friend of his Grace’s.</p>
                <p>If you can discover who has bought <persName ref="pe0093">Edmondson</persName>'s stock, the plate may be found.</p>
                <p><persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName>'s account went with the <del>p</del>drawings. The shell is the Pomatia see
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0032">journey to London</title></bibl>. p. 336. in the note<note type="editorial">Pennant notes the reference correctly, as a note on p. 336 of <hi rend="italic">The journey from Chester to London</hi> (1782). See further <ref target="1064.xml">1064</ref>.</note>
                    <persName ref="pe0379">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chiswel</persName> has caused <persName ref="pe0324">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingleby</persName>

                    if you wish it <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName> shall copy them on thin paper for you.</p>
                <p>I wish very much to reprint 60 copies of my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">Introduction to the arctic Zoology</title></bibl><note type="editorial">This apparently refers to 'Introduction of the Arctic World', first published in <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi> (1784), I, and suggests that Pennant had plans as early as the late 1780s for its reissue as the first of three volumes in a second edition in 1792, entitled <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0690">Introduction to the Arctic zoology</title></bibl>.</note>
                    on the same paper &amp; type as <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0368"><persName ref="pe0045">Cook</persName>'s voyage</title></bibl>,
                    the finest copy. I do not grudge you or any friend any little expences I may now &amp; then be on their account: but now think I have a little clame
                    in calling the few the <hi rend="underline">very few</hi> on whose candor I can rely to bear a small proportion of expence in what I shall certainly 
                    not gain, but most probably lose. It is a favorite work of mine, &amp; much so with foreigners. it is my whim that a few copies appear in splendor. 
                    I put each copy at 2 guineas will <persName ref="pe0313">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bull</persName> take one or more?
                    I say 60 copies: but only 50 will be for <placeName ref="pl0775">England</placeName>. the other ten I shall send gratuitously to foreign 
                    ac<del>ca</del>ademies. take this plan in the light of a friend, as perfectly uninterested.</p>
