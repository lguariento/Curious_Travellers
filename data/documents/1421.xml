                    object of the business. He talked of having my name to the plan about the Padoucas. I would chearfully give it, if that is 
                    all: but <sic>if it follow’d by</sic> correspondencies, meetings or any trouble I must decline. I am now 65.<note type="editorial">This 
                        suggests a date of 1791 for this letter, but a number of factors argue for a date of 1792. The Bull-Pennant correspondence suggests 
                        that Pennant was not in London in April 1790 (<ref target="1129.xml">1129</ref> (7 April 1791) shows him instructing Bull to get a 
                        print from London portrait 
                        print dealer William Richardson and in <ref target="1131.xml">1131</ref> (16 April 1791) he is busily involved with 
                        extra-illustrating at home in Downing). In 1792, on the other hand, he reports on 13 March 
                        (<ref target="1151.xml">1151</ref>) that 'We are now forty miles on our way to town' and names 'No. 5 George Street Hanover Square' 
                        as his address, noting that 'we shall not reach it till Friday' (which would have been 16 March 1792); and in a letter of 8 &amp; 9 May 
                        (<ref target="1152.xml">1152</ref>) is making arrangements for Bull to visit him there in two days' time. Of the two publications by 
                        Williams regarding the discovery of America by Madog, the second, <hi rend="italic">Farther observations</hi>, seems more attuned to 
                        the contents of this letter by Pennant. It mentions the Padoucas several times (whereas the earlier publication makes no mention at all 
                        of them), and appears, in its preface, to be urging the need for sending people out to explore the premise that Welsh, and Welsh-speaking 
                        Indians, were alive on the north American continent. See <hi rend="italic">Farther observations, on the discovery of America, by Prince Madog ab Owen 
                        Gwynedd, about the year, 1170</hi> (London: J. Brown, 1792), pp. iii–iv. April 1792 was the period of the formation of the Madogeion 
                        Society, in which Pughe was highly influential, and the content of this letter from Pennant to Pughe may well reflect the bustle 
                        surrounding that project. Carr, <hi rend="italic">William Owen Pughe</hi>, pp. 41–2; NLW 9072E, p. 255.</note> &amp; so oppressed with
