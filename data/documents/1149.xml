                <p>
                    I rejoic’d to be inform'd from <persName ref="pe0234">Miss Pennant</persName>, that You were all in good health. I return’d to her at the time you specified, the 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0333">small Print of yourself</rs>, pasted indeed, but, from the hurry I was in, so wretchedly pasted, that I would recommend 
                    <persName ref="pe0014">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gryffith</persName> the doing it over again, and upon smoother paper, cutting off the dirt that I made,, if the print will allow of it, before 
                    He adds the ornaments intended. have the goodness to make him understan<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>d
                    that I mean it to front the Title page, of the <del>Journe</del> <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0268">Voyage from London to Dover</title></bibl>, of which I shall make two pretty thick Volumes. Do me the justice to believe that no <hi rend="underline">M.S.</hi>
                    of yours, with which you have indulged me, has ever been lent to, or at present, even seen, by any person whatever; I would not, I could not, make you such an ungratefull return. – I have always held in abhorrence that abominable custom, of leaving to the mercy of Executors, posthumous papers, and letters, often confidential, always improper to be in the possession of hungry Booksellers, who purchase them for the sole purpose, of making public, what perhaps no third person ought to have known. 
                    The <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0077">Book of Quadrupeds</title></bibl>, which you have been kind enough to give me,
                    is the prettiest work of the kind I have ever seen, and I thank you for it extremely. I found the <hi rend="underline"><rs type="art" ref="ar0334">Whiff</rs></hi>
                    in the place where you bid me look for it, but the letter you desir’d me to return by the post, was in no part of the Book, or the parcell, which I carefully unpack’d myself, and could not well overlook, or drop out, because your letter, which I receiv’d long before I sent for the parcell, had prepared me to search for it, and I did so very minutely, tho’ in vain.</p>
                <p>
                    I like the <rs type="art" ref="ar0333">portrait</rs> well, it is better than I had expected, having look’d only for the old Print cut down to a two Decker. I dont know if I report 
                    <persName ref="pe0328">Falders</persName> answer as I should do – He told me, I think he did, that the Books<note type="editorial">The books in question have not been identified.</note>
                    were are all ready to be deliver’d, and that he waited for some few copies, which were yet to be colour’d. 
                    – I have nothing to tell You, except of the Riot at <placeName ref="pl1673">Dublin</placeName> - some man in the Gallery at the House of commons there, would sit with his hat on, tho the 
                    <persName ref="pe1678">Speaker</persName> repremanded him, on which a member moved for clearing the Gallery, which was done of course, but the people, who did not relish being turn'd out, waited till the Speaker went home,
                    &amp; after breaking the <del>wind</del> Glasses of the State coach, follow’d him home, and broke every window in his house.<note type="editorial">This story was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Kentish Gazette</hi>, 31 January 1792.</note>
                    I don’t vouch for the truth of the above, but <persName ref="pe1680">Harry Hobart</persName> told it me, who is likely to know. – Our best goodwishes al<del>l</del>ways wait upon you, and yours.</p>
