                <p>A sudden call my <persName ref="pe0234">eldest Daughter</persName> has to <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName>
                    to her worthy <persName ref="pe0237">aunt</persName> who has long labord under a painful illness enables me to send you the 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0077">History of quadrupeds with wooden plates</title></bibl>; &amp; <rs type="art" ref="ar0333">my print</rs>.
                    In the first is the <rs type="art" ref="ar0334">drawing of the Whiff</rs>.<note type="editorial">The presence of the drawing of the whiff inside the copy sent to Bull of Ralph Beilby, <hi rend="italic">A general history of Quadrupeds</hi>, does not appear to relate to the content of the book. See further <ref target="1147.xml">1147</ref>.</note> at the latter end (by mistake) is a letter of the author’s:<note type="editorial">Pennant refers to a letter written by himself, inadvertently included in the parcel brought by his daughter, Arabella, to London.</note>
                    be so good as to take it out &amp; return it by post. I send you the print that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> may paste it on such paper as inclosed: When returnd 
                    <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName> shall decorate it. If you send for these at 7 o’clock on Thursday evening to

                    they will be deliverd to y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> order. If you can push it so as to be deliverd by 3 the next day, It may be brought me by 
                    a returning Servant. you are the only one that shall have a copy of <rs type="art" ref="ar0333">this print</rs>
                    till it is publish’d.</p>
                <p>
                    I was a good deal startled the other day by seeing a <sic>poem by</sic> mine in a newspaper: I could not account for it: till I recollected I had given copies of my 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0179">miscellanies</title></bibl> to <persName ref="pe0068">Lort</persName>
                    &amp; <persName ref="pe0105">Grose</persName>: both their effects were sold: &amp; thus I am given to the public much malgré moy.<note type="editorial">'in spite of myself'.</note>
                    I have given also copies of my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0686">literary life</title></bibl>. I have no fear of you nor yrs: but of 
                    <del>other</del> the executors of others I may. I shall therefore publish it myself with some droll advertisement. you know I have declared myself dead as an author. so my
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0686">literary life</title></bibl> may fairly be publishd. <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName>
                    will immediately undertake the <rs type="art" ref="ar0306">Lusty Packingdon</rs>.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName ref="pe0065">My Son</persName>'s want of confidence will prevent his taking your excellent advice but I trust the world will have the sagacity to discover what he will never be forward to disclose. The treasures he brings home will be no small embellishments to my margins.</p>
                <p>
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0311">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Caecilia</rs> is a beastly affair: but there is some humour in the Genius.</p>
                <p>
                    I rejoice at the reform I have workd among the burial grounds:<note type="editorial">See marginalia to <ref target="1147.xml">1147</ref> for a newspaper cutting relating to Pennant's 'admonition on the Burials at St. Giles'.</note>
