The little ballance, he will be pleased to place to account, and send me a remit upon the Bill enclosed, for I am above regarding Stamp duties.</p>
                <p>I have been with <persName ref="pe0026">White</persName>, who tells me you was making up an Order for him, but that he did not at all know when he should have any parcell to send You, in the meantime I have executed most of your little commissions; and have got the undermention’d prints ready to send you in any manner you please to direct.
