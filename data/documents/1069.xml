                <p>As you &amp; I have not much time to lose, I trouble you with a<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>n 
                    immediate Letter of thanks. The <del>d<gap unit="letters" quantity="6" reason="illegible"/></del>note is received &amp; is a 
                    full discharge. As to <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName> I <sic>toke</sic> care to settle affairs with him some time ago. He is now 
                    out of work for want of the sheets of the arctic Zoology.<note type="editorial">This may be a reference to the preparations for a new edition of <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi>, 
                        featuring the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0690">'Introduction'</title></bibl>. See further n. 2, below. </note> 
                    As you know best how to prepare them for receiving marginal drawings, Be so good as to get as many sheets as are printed, 
                    &amp; procure them to be pressed in the manner you treat y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> books &amp; let them be 
                    <hi rend="underline">instantly</hi> sent by the <placeName ref="pl0002">Chester</placeName> coach with such parcels that 
                    <persName ref="pe0111">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>Hughs</persName> has for me.</p>
                <p>As I propose much pleasure from this work, age pressing on, I put the Introduction
                    into the press, that I may enjoy the beautiful illuminations ready for it.<note type="editorial">Pennant may here be signalling the preparation of 
                        a new edition of the introductory essay, <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">'Introduction of the Arctic World'</title></bibl>, under 
                        the title <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0690">'Introduction to the Arctic zoology'</title></bibl>. This eventually became 
                    the first volume of the second edition of the work, which was published in 1792.</note> Possibly I never may live to see the 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0023">Zoological part</title></bibl> printed. I therefore recommend you to buy a
                    L. P. copy. you may burn the <del>old <gap unit="letters" quantity="7" reason="illegible"/></del> Introduction belonging to it, 
                    &amp; put the Quadrupeds, the Land Birds, &amp; the water fowl into three vols. in boards.<note type="editorial">Pennant appears to be advising Bull 
                        to purchase a copy of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Arctic zoology</hi> (1784â€“5) to use alongside a new version 
                        of the 'Introduction of the Arctic World' (1784) in the absence of a second edition of the entire work, which did not appear until 1792.</note> I can give you many additional 
                    p<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>rints even for those. Do you chuse any views on separate leaves 
                    that are too big for the margins for I have some very fine. apropos buy <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0622"><persName ref="pe0858">Phips</persName> voy. to Spitzbergen</title></bibl>
                    in <hi rend="underline">sheets</hi> as I have. the prints are good &amp; to our purpose. also <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0623"><persName ref="pe0859">Fred. Martens</persName> voy to Spitzbergen</title></bibl>.</p>
                <p>yr drawing shall be done as you desire. &amp; I shall get one done for myself.<note type="editorial">This drawing has not been identified.</note>
                    <persName ref="pe0014">moses</persName> is only to work for you &amp; me till th<del>is</del>e 
                    opus magnum is finished.<note type="authorial">Although Pennant generally reserved the term 'magnum opus' for his 
                        <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0475">'Outlines of the Globe'</title></bibl> he may here be referring to work on the 
                        <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0025">'Introduction of the Arctic World'</title></bibl>, which he developed 
                        into <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0690">'Introduction to the Arctic zoology'</title></bibl>, and in which he involved Bull, 
                        according to the evidence of this letter. His own copy of the 'Introduction' eventually formed a part of the 'Outlines'.</note></p>
