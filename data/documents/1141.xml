                <p>Half a dozen lines, are better than no answer at all; let me give you my best thanks for your last letter, 
                    and express, as well as I can en abregé,<note type="editorial">'in a shortened form, briefly'.</note> my
                attachment to You.</p>
                <p>I had one foot in the Stirrup for <placeName ref="pl0796">Bath</placeName>, on account of <persName ref="pe0336">my daughters</persName>
                    ill health. She has now rallied again, and we have postpon’d our journey till the Spring Season, if unluckily her complaints should return. 
                    I thank <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> for his overtures to colour a set of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0022">Arctic Zoology</title></bibl>
                    prints for my Book, and I readily adopt his plan, and will allow him what times he pleases for doing the same. has he by him, a set of the prints 
                    <hi rend="underline">upon a large paper</hi>? and will he like to colour <hi rend="underline">them</hi>, and that I should send 
                    <hi rend="underline">him</hi> mine, when I have an opportunity of doing it? Should he have no set of the prints upon a large paper,
                    I can send down mine to him, but it cannot be till about the middle of the next month, as they are in <placeName ref="pl0759">Stratton Street</placeName>,
                    and I shall hardly be there much sooner myself.</p>
                <p>You seem in a fair way to give <persName ref="pe0419">Palmer</persName>, the set down, he well deserves, and I hope he will 
                    profit by your gentle chastisement. We have lived in a whirlwind for this month past, and storm and tempest our potion to drink.
                    one flash of lightening knock'd down four men out of five, who were at plow, in a field not far from us, the men <del>of</del>
                    have since recover’d, but three of the Horses, were left dead upon the spot, and a poney in my yard receiv'd a little shock 
                    <del>in my yard <gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del> from the same flash.</p>
                <p><placeName ref="pl1479">Newport</placeName> has been in an uproar since the day before yesterday, when one of our two Banks there, stop’d payment; the firm was 
                    <persName ref="pe1597">Gregory and Roberts</persName>,
                    and we suppose this dimunative spot, as the business now stands, will sustain a loss of £40,000. every body is a sufferer, in some degree. – these are the short, but not the simple 
                    Annals of the <placeName ref="pl1020">Isle of Wight</placeName>.</p>

                    <salute>our best good wishes attend all, of the House of Pennant.
