                <p>my Friend <persName ref="pe0412">Minchin</persName> promiss’d to send me to day, some little account of the Forest you saw from 
                    <placeName ref="pl1703">Port-Down</placeName>, but by some blunder or other I have receiv’d only the frank, which it is pity to lose, 
                    so I write a line or two that I may correct a blunder of my own. the Forest in question, which I told you was 
                    <placeName ref="pl1704">Waltham</placeName>, is the <placeName ref="pl1582">Forest of Beere</placeName>, &amp; when I receive 
                    his account a few days hence, (for I go into <placeName ref="pl1388">Essex</placeName> to morrow) you shall have it directly after my return. 
                    The <rs type="art" ref="ar0168">Drawing of Lord Fanhope</rs>, which <persName ref="pe0397">Lord Malmesbury</persName> has got
                    a <persName ref="pe1243">lady</persName> to take from the original picture of <persName ref="pe0386">Sir <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="3" reason="damage"/></del>George Cornwalls</persName> in <placeName ref="pl1653">herefordshire</placeName>,
                    arriv’d last night, and I have this morning carried it to Carter<note type="editorial">The identity of Carter is uncertain. Bull and Pennant had 
                        previously employed <persName ref="pe1373">John Carter</persName> of Westminster to copy drawings, but it is possible that by 1791 they were employing <persName ref="pe0376">George Carter</persName>, whose expertise was in history painting.</note> to copy for your 
                    <add place="above">acceptance</add>. – 'tis merely a head. –––</p>
                <p>I have got from <persName ref="pe0026">White</persName> the two Title pages to your <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0032">Journey to London</title></bibl>,
                    which answer my purpose very well. –</p>
                <p>I wait your list of Spanish, and African prints you have occasion for, that I may look among mine, and send 'em you down when I send 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0168">Lord Fanhope</rs>. I can furnish you with a very good <rs type="art" ref="ar0223">Charles V</rs>, &amp;
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar0224">Philip II<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></rs>, and, I <hi rend="underline">believe</hi>, I have some <sic>where 
                    got</sic> the <rs type="art" ref="ar0225">present King and &amp; Queen of Spain</rs>, if You want them. when I get your list, I will hunt at the print shops also. I have the
