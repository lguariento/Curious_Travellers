                <p>I was favoured with your Letter last night on my Return here. I am sorry that I did not happen to be in the way 
                when it arrived to return you an immediate Answer.</p>
                
                <p>The Paper which <persName ref="pe0598">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrington</persName> put into your Hands is an 
                    Extract out of a MS of <persName ref="pe2126">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J Price</persName> <placeName ref="pl1553">Bodley</placeName> 
                    Librarian, and you have his hearty concurrence to make what use you please of it. I claim no Property in it, neither have 
                    I any Intention of making any further Use of it, it is therefore entirely at your Service. <persName ref="pe0216">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris</persName> 
                    of the <placeName ref="pl3043">Navy Office</placeName> informs me that it was published last Century by <persName ref="pe2128">John Rhydderch</persName> in his 
                    <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0709">Welch Grammar</title></bibl>.<note type="editorial">Jones may be referring to the classification of the letters 
                        ('Dosparthiad y Llythrennau') associated with the name of Edern (or Edeyrn) Dafod Aur, a copy of which was included in the Red Book of Hergest at the
                        Bodleian Library. See Roderick, <hi rend="italic">Grammadeg Cymraeg</hi> (1728), pp. 39–46; and John Morris Jones, ‘Dosbarth Edern Dafod Aur’, <hi rend="italic">THSC</hi> (1923–4), 1–28. 
                        The claim that Roderick's 
                        <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> had been published 
                    in the previous century is clearly erroneous.</note> I beg you will accept of my sincere thanks for the Assistance which you so obligingly offer me. I have 
                    nothing simlar to your Plan in View and therefore I will at all Times give you any Information in my Power with the greatest Pleasure. My Leisure 
                    Hours are chiefly employed about a <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0707">MS of old British Musick</title></bibl> belonging to <persName ref="pe0216">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris</persName> above mentioned which 
                    <persName ref="pe0598">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrington</persName> very obligingly has been at the Pains to procure me the use of, for sometime. As it is written in a manner 
                    which seems to be peculiar to the Britains the Decyphering of it is attended with no small Difficulty. If any thing relative to that Subject falls 
                    in your way, I shall take it as a particular Favour, if you will be so obliging as to communicate it to me.
                </p>
                <p>I have sent you a specimen of the Musick in the MS. on the opposite Page that in Case you meet with any thing similar to it, it may not escape your Notice. 
                    <persName ref="pe2126">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price</persName> desires his best Respects to you. <persName ref="pe2130">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persName>
                    gives him great Hopes that the Drawings sent to <persName ref="pe2129">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rivington</persName> will be recovered. I wish you 
                all possible Success in your Undertaking and am with great Esteem</p>
