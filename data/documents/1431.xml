                    about a Fortnight, <del><gap reason="authorial" unit="letters" quantity="2"/></del>which I am the more sorry for as you are desirous of an immediate Answer. I have 
                    therefore taken the first Opportunity to let you know that I have consulted <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0711">Dodsworth</title></bibl>

                is a very valuable one. It consists of 164 Volumes, of which 49 are of his own handwriting. They are chiefly Copies of Original Deeds charters Pedigrees &amp;c 
                especially relating to Abbies &amp;c. and as they were collected before the rage of civil War had destroyed the Originals, they are very extensive, 
                taking in almost all the Counties in England, but as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <persName ref="pe2139">Dodsworth</persName> was a native of <placeName ref="pl0770">yorkshire</placeName> 
                there are more particulars relating to that County than to any other. I have sent the Passages in
