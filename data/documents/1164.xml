                <opener><salute>My dear Sir,</salute><dateline><placeName ref="pl0759">Stratton Street</placeName>. March 8. 1793</dateline></opener>
                <p>I hope and trust you have passed a more agreeable winter than I have done, in the midst of Apozems,<note type="editorial">Med. A decoction or infusion.</note>
                    and <sic>elmulsions</sic>, which are ever my aversion, &amp; never do good. my confinement has been perpetual; In the winter I am forced to roll myself up, like 
                    a wood:louse, and be content to remain in a torpid state, even in such days, as invite reptiles, <hi rend="underline">apparently</hi>
                    worse than myself, to crawl about; in short I am a non discript animal, that would puzzle the best naturalist of you all.</p>
                <p>I have at last got two copies upon large paper of the <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0272">new Edition of London</title></bibl>,
                    one of which, I shall keep till I have the pleasure of seeing you, or of receiving your directions about; the 
                    other I shall pay for, and take care it is not charged to your account; there is no reason why it should be so. 
                    <persName ref="pe0328">Faulder</persName>, the Prince of puzzle pates, has sent the Plates quite imperfect, and two of them so torn, and rumpled, 
                    that I have sent them back to be changed, together with half a dozen sheets of the letter press, which are too dirty for our use.</p>
                <p>
                    The <hi rend="underline">early</hi> intelligence the publishers of news:papers now contrive to procure, has completely ruin’d all private informations, which correspondents heretofore, were mutually enabled to oblige their friends with. every thing by way of news nowadays, from a private pen, comes in, lagging, like a distanc’d horse.</p>
                <p>
                    It is a matter of great pleasure to every body to know, that the troops are arriv’d in <placeName ref="pl1228">Holland</placeName>,
                    safe, and well – our fears about them, were by no means groundless. they sail’d in too great a hurry, and not well equip’d.
                    one of the transports forgot to take any ballast on board; some of the cannon were intended for that purpose, but it did not arrive in time, and so they sail’d without even a gravel Ballast.</p>
                <p>
                    There seems but one opinion about <placeName ref="pl2525">Breda</placeName>, – that it was lost by treachery.<note type="editorial">The French general Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez led an offensive into Holland in February 1793, taking Breda on 25 February. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Longman Companion to the French Revolution</hi>, p. 26.</note>
                    the Riots in <placeName ref="pl1023">Paris</placeName>, and <placeName ref="pl2526">Lyons</placeName>, and in others of their provinces, begin to grow charmingly Lawless.<note type="editorial">The <hi rend="italic">Kentish Gazette</hi>, 5 March 1793, reports on the capture of Breda by French forces, on 'dreadful riots' at Lyons, and on the recent attack on 'persons at Paris selling provisions, bakers, grocers, &amp;c . . . by a hungry and powerful mob'.</note></p>
                <p>
                    A Seperate Peace, between the Prussians, and the French, is already talked of, but surely without foundation, tho’, I for one, have a bad opinion of <persName ref="pe1716">Frederick</persName>.</p>
