                <p>I now inclose <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> receit: there is some addition to the bill by work done since, 
                    which shall be accounted for. I have paid him *20<hi rend="superscript">£</hi> which you will please to put into the

                    you would have the drawings entered at the coach office to their full value which may be a security to them. <hi rend="underline">Now</hi>
                    I most sensibly feel my loss; being engaged in the toilsome task of new writing my <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0268">journey 
                        from the Temple stairs to <placeName ref="pl1381">Dover</placeName></title></bibl>.

                <p>I am sorry for the occasion which brings you so early to <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName>: But it will give

                    a fortnight &amp; then left me. I trust y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ails are also removed, that I may have a little enjoyment of you in march: So 
                    I hope you will oil y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> hinges against that time. I have not the honor of knowing <persName ref="pe0382">Lady Clarges</persName>:
                    I write so much &amp; think so much that I lose the habit of talking: so shun all conversations &amp; dread the meeting of a wit.

                    &amp; was very agreable: for I will allow that wits may be so, in their lucid intervals. as to <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName>
                    the sighs of my munificent <persName ref="pe0237">sister</persName> &amp; the desire of being with <persName ref="pe0065">my son</persName>

                    I have m<del>y</del>any inducements. <persName ref="pe0065">my son</persName> takes to the place: &amp; our, or rather his improvements go on rapidly.<note type="editorial">David Pennant's involvement in the improvement of the Downing estate extended to a keen interest in 
                        horticulture and meteorology (he kept a diary of weather readings made at Downing between 1793 and 1835), and led to alterations to the estate
