It included performances of several oratorios by Handel, a fancy ball, and concluded with a public breakfast to the accompaniment of 'Catches and Glees'. <hi rend="italic">Chester Chronicle</hi>, 18 July 1783; 5, 19 and [27] September 1783.</note> If you will come before the

                    in paste-ology.<note type="editorial">The reference to 'I and mine' suggests that members of the household besides Pennant and Moses Griffith (see <ref target="1011.xml">1011</ref>) may have been involved in 'pasting'. His wife Ann Pennant (née Mostyn) and elder daughter, Arabella, are possible candidates. On Bull and Pennant's lack of overt reference to Elizabeth and Catherine Bull's involvement in pasting, and the underlying protection of females from explicit and acknowledged participation in the masculine world of antiquarianism, see Peltz, 'The Extra-Illustration of London', vol. 2, pp 502–6.</note></p>

                    suspicions.<note type="editorial">The King's speech at the close of the session in 16 July 1783, when he prorogued Parliament to 9 September, mentioned that 'the consideration of the affairs of the East Indies will require to be resumed as early as possible', talking of 'terms of pacification' which he believed 'the several powers concerned' were much inclined to. This does not seem to corroborate Pennant's gloomy outlook, especially since the Anglo-French contest in the East Indies, afoot since 1778, was brought to a conclusion with the signing of the Paris Treaty on 3 September 1783 (see <ref target="1016.xml">1016</ref>, n. 1).</note>
