                            (see note below). For editorial purposes the letter has been re-dated to
                                3 February 1776.</p>

                <p>I beg leave to return your congratulations of the seasons &amp;c &amp; the same
                    time to hope to receive better accounts of the health of poor <persName ref="pe0156">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Low</persName> than the last. I
                    most sincerely regret his ill state of health; on several reasons; for his own
                    sake, &amp; the loss which the public will sustain by that of his labors. I
                    wrote to him immediately but not in such a manner as to alarm him. I thank you
                    for the offer of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0064">magazines</title></bibl>. I shall be glad to pay for a years set; but not
                    to receive them singly.</p>
                <p>I see in <sic>days</sic> paper a very angry Letter from a Macgregor relating to

                        reply of March 25 1776. The letter itself takes issue with Pennant's account
                        of an alleged massacre of the Colquhoun clan by the MacGregors near Luss in
                        1603 (specifically as it appeared in the quarto edition of <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0004">A Tour in Scotland 1769</title>

                        of the letter makes reference to an extract from Pennant's <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0004"><hi rend="italic">Tour in Scotland

                        wrong month when dating this letter, and that it was actually written on
                        February 3 rather than January 3.</note> I believe all can be supported from
