                <p>I am sorry that you so easily give up the poor principality.<note type="editorial">See <ref target="1036.xml">1036</ref>.</note> <placeName ref="pl1047">Tower</placeName> 
                    certainly would never do for your family, being much to small: but I was not acquainted with y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> number.
                    <persName ref="pe0226">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Panton</persName> some time ago returned your Compliments:
                    &amp; mentioned to me a new house built by a clergyman who is ruined by the expence. Itâ€™s situation is

                    in sight of everything that is great. It is unfurnished: but if you could think of a longer retreat than one summer it may suit you. Had you not best make a tour with 
                    Miss Bulls<note type="editorial"><persName ref="pe0331">Elizabeth</persName> and <persName ref="pe0336">Catherine</persName>.</note> &amp; explore the Country. <placeName ref="pl0001">here</placeName>
                    you will find warm lodgings as long as you please. This failing I shall be silent.</p>

                    I am not interested the lest in <placeName ref="pl0731">S.

                    I rejoice at the political change; &amp; may say that the <del>pub</del> welsh public strongly befriends in theory but wants principle to give their sentiments, useful effect. Whenever
