                <p>You relieved me from my despair of ever hearing from you again. I began to fear that something amiss had befel you 
                    &amp; yours: &amp; now lament that my suspicions are in some measure true. Possibly you will think that a still 
                    warmer air than that of <placeName ref="pl1020">vectis</placeName> will be necessary for your <persName ref="pe0336">fair daughter</persName>'s
                    recovery. <persName ref="pe0065">My son</persName> will rejoice to have the advantage of waiting on you in the south of

                    next winter as I shall make that the year of rustication: so I forsee double advantages in my journey: but more of this when we all meet in March.</p>
                <p>I thank you for keeping me in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> thoughts in respect to my queries. I have written all I can respecting the

                <p>I am thankful for the good health with which Providence has blessed me &amp; mine: &amp; for numbers of other good things of this life.
