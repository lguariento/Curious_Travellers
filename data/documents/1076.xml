Its founder, Sir Foster Cunliffe (1755–1834), was the owner of Acton Park near Wrexham, where several of the society's meetings were held, although some were also staged at other north Wales estates, including Wynnstay and, as proven by this letter, Erddig, also near Wrexham. Female membership was advocated from the beginning.
