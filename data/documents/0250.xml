                <salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener>
                <p>I truely lament the loss of our worthy friend; which is more grievous as it was
                    rather unexpected after the receit of his note. He has at all times been true to
                    me: which increases my regret.<note type="editorial"><persName ref="pe0022">Doctor Robert Ramsay</persName>, first Chair of Natural History at

                    miscarriage cannot be helped.<note type="editorial">Previous letters mention a
                        missing copy of <hi rend="italic">A Tour in Wales</hi> which was intended

                <p>I discovered by chance the friend who so kindly defends me against y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> wild clans. I am sure it is a <persName ref="pe0095">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Douglas</persName> near

                    generous as I said as harsh yet as true things against the <unclear reason="illegible">patent</unclear> earls of his name.<note type="editorial">In his <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0008"><hi rend="italic">Tour in
