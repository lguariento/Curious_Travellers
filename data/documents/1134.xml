                <opener><salute>Dear Sir</salute><dateline>May <del>April</del> 5. 1791.</dateline></opener>
                <p>I trouble you with a few hasty lines, to inform You, that I sent a parcell, in consequence of your directions, to 
                    <persName ref="pe0237">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pennant</persName> in <placeName ref="pl0798">Upper Grosvenor Street</placeName>,
                    yesterday, enclosing the Prints you was kind enough to offer me the choice of; and altho I wanted a very few, I 
                    feel myself as much oblig’d, as if I had purloin’d the whole. I sent you also some parcells receiv’d from 
                    <persName ref="pe0328">Faulder</persName>, and a few trumpery prints from my own Stock, but not having 
                    been well of late I have not been able to look about for you, as I wish’d to have done. You will find the 
                    <persName ref="pe0043">Cadel</persName>'s <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0201">new System</title></bibl>, which 
                    I have heard well spoken of, and I am asham’d of my ignorance in having spoken ill of it, in a former letter: pray 
                    tell me, if it is worth my buying; I mean for the purpose of cutting up for any of your publications. I am sorry to 
                    find I am to expect only a few drawings upon the Margin of <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0268">the Journey from London to Dover</title></bibl>,
                    because much natural history seems a proper appendage to that work: However, let me pick <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName>'s
                    brains ever so much, I cannot expect more than their quintessence, which I have the good luck to be already possess’d of.. We leave 
                    <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName> the first of June, before which time, I shall hope to receive the M.S. that I may take it with me 
                    to the <placeName ref="pl1020">Island</placeName>, and the more drawings I <hi rend="underline">find upon the Margins, the better I shall like it</hi>.
                    – ’tis the V<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Volume of <bibl type="authorial"> <title ref="bi0148">ch<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="2" reason="illegible"/></del>urch<del><gap unit="letters" quantity="1" reason="illegible"/></del>ill's voyages</title></bibl>
                    which you will want, which contains <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0196">Barbot’s discription of Guinea</title></bibl>; if you find it, let me 
                    know, for I shall keep looking out. <hi rend="underline">By all means, let me have a copy of <rs type="art" ref="ar0306">lusty Packington</rs></hi>.
                    - I should like to have <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0334">Boy’s history of Sandwich</title></bibl>, if I knew where to get it.</p>
                <p><persName ref="pe0500">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pitt</persName> has sent word to the <placeName ref="pl1474">Russia</placeName>
                    merchants, that <add place="above">they</add> may fit out their Ships for <placeName ref="pl1474">Russia</placeName> with safety till September, when they 
                    will receive fresh informations, respecting the part this Country means to take, in case the turkish war continues.<note type="editorial">Pitt sought alternatives for British imports from Russia during 1790–1, looking at the possibility of an alliance with Poland and Turkey. Whereas some British voices called for an offensive against an expansionist Russia, Whigs opposed such a move and Pitt himself, even, was ambivalent on its wisdom. Following the appointment of William Grenville as foreign secretary in mid-April 1791, the impetus for conflict was severely dented, and an agreement between Russia and the Triple Alliance (Great Britain, Prussia and the United Provinces) together with a truce between Russia and Turkey was reached in July 1791. Jerzy ŁoJek, 'British policy toward Russia, 1790–1791, and Polish affairs', <hi rend="italic">The Polish Review</hi>, 28, no. 2 (1983), 3–17; Jeremy Black, <hi rend="italic">British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783–1793</hi> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), pp. 314–328.</note>
                    A report to day has prevail’d of the death of the <persName ref="pe0824">King of the french</persName>, 
                    but it is not believ’d. I can satisfie your females curiosity with regard to <persName ref="pe0370">Lady Cholmondeleys</persName>
                    nightcaps, with some exactness, for altho’ I was not at the wedding myself, I supp’d the same night, with some of the Bride maids. – 
                    She had 12 night caps at nine guineas each, and we are told they had all Veils. – it put me in mind of the Rehearsal,
                    <lb/>"What means Luna in a veil,?
                    <lb/>Luna means to shew her tail.<note type="editorial">George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and others, <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi>, Act V, scene I, lines 313–14.</note></p>
                <p>’tis  the fashion to say there is a wide difference, betwixt <persName ref="pe0370">Lady Cholmondeley</persName>, and
                    <persName ref="pe1287">Lady Cardigan</persName>. the answer enquirers after the latter, receive, is, that 
                    <persName ref="pe0372">my Lord</persName> is as well as can be expected, and <persName ref="pe1287">her Ladyship</persName>
                    much the same as She was. –—– </p>

                    (which I cut out of some newspaper,) because I have occasion for it.</p>
