                    since sent to you. I shall be glad to know by Christmas the number of persons
                    who wish to have the plates of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Ed. in octavo
                    size none can be had afterwards.<note type="editorial">Apparently a reference to
                        the separate purchase of plates from Pennant's <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0008"><hi rend="italic">Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the

                        available plates are mentioned later in the letter.</note> I have <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0149">Adair</title></bibl>. I am glad you

                <p><persName ref="pe0054">Col. Roy</persName> has behaved to me with great
                    politeness &amp; has been very communicative. I believe it is not at present in
                    his power to give any more of his maps away. I have seen it more than once &amp;
                    very fine it is.<note type="editorial">Gwyn Walters suggests that the maps
                        Pennant refers to here are engraved proofs of William Roy's <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0140">'Mappa Britanniae
                                Septentrionalis'</title></bibl>, later published in his <bibl type="editorial"><title ref="bi0202"><hi rend="italic">Military Antiquities of

                        However Walters also suggests that Pennant's second reference, apparently to
                        a single map, might correspond to Roy's 'original protraction' for the much
                        larger <bibl><title ref="bi0211">Military Survey of Scotland,
