                <p>I would write with red ink, If I had any, to bear testimony how I blush’d to receive a second letter from you,
                    before I had answer’d the first, but in truth for these eight weeks past, I have been a poor unprofitable 
                    creature, either to myself or my friends, for so long is it, since I have been confind almost to my chair, by 
                    an unlucky fall, which displaced the bone of my knee, and crippled me completely. <persName ref="pe0529">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hunter</persName>
                    however <add place="above">says</add> I shall recover my walking strength again, if I will but have patience, to which I can only answer, 
                    ægrotāntibus facile concilium damus.<note type="editorial">'Patients can easily give advice'. Bull appears to be playing on the maxim 'Facile omnes cum valemus recta consilia aegrotis damus' ('We all, while we are well, easily give good advice to the sick'), Terence, <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, line 309.</note>
                    I think I gave you a M.S. copy of <persName ref="pe0434">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Walpole</persName>'s <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0068">tragedy</title></bibl>,
                    which I had better have thrown into the fire, for I since find it is very imperfect, and the writer, not being a Poet, has made a great 
                    part of it Prose. distroy it, and I will some time or other give you a corrected copy, or perhaps the tragedy itself, for I have
                    got one, and am promiss’d a second. I find it quite impracticable to bind up the Welch tour,<note type="editorial">It is not certain which edition of Pennant's <hi rend="italic">A tour in Wales</hi> was being extra-illustrated by Bull.</note>
                    and <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0032">journey to London</title></bibl> this Spring, tho’ I much wish’d to do it, on account of the Volumes being deranged and soiled by every fresh person, who is ready to tumble them over. If therefore 
                    <persName ref="pe0014">Moses</persName> can recollect any drawings he has made for the Welch tour<note type="editorial">See n. 2, above.</note>
                    or <bibl type="authorial"><title ref="bi0032">journey to London</title></bibl>, copies of which, <hi rend="underline">he has not already sent me</hi>,
                    I should <add place="above">like</add> so many of them, as he can find time to do for me before the middle of November, when I shall certainly do up my Volumes, else I have been working for my Heirs, and not for my own enjoyment, for I feel infirmities, and decrepitude hastening upon 
                    <del><gap unit="letters" quantity="2" reason="illegible"/></del>Me, and no matter how soon my curtain drops. I take it for granted, He knows what drawings have been already remitted to me, and beg him not to forget the instruction I send in the enclos’d paper, relative to the size of the Drawings.<note type="editorial">The enclosure has not survived, but see <ref target="1083.xml">1083</ref> for Bull's memoranda to himself to send Moses Griffith a catalogue of the drawings that he has already.</note></p>
                <p>Probably the Prints of <rs type="art" ref="ar1069">The triumphs of riches and poverty</rs>, which are publish’d in the
                    book you mention,<note type="editorial">Note that a letter from Pennant to Bull on this topic, pre-dating that of 6 May 1789 (<ref target="1084.xml">1084</ref>) and possibly naming the book in question, does not appear to have survived. The reference to the 'Editor of Holbein's work' at the end of this paragraph may provide a clue as to the identity of the book, however. <hi rend="italic">Oeuvre de Jean Holbein ou recueil de gravures d'après les plus beaux ouvrages de ce fameux peintre</hi> (Basel: Christian von Mechel, 1780–1795), contains 53 prints after paintings and drawings by Hans Holbein, the younger, including 'Triumphus Divitiarum' (<hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Riches</hi>) and 'Triumphus Paupertatis' (<hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Poverty</hi>). Its publisher, von Mechel, may be considered as its editor. See  <ref type="http" target="https://tinyurl.com/ya2eb5je">here</ref> [accessed 5 September 2018].</note>
                    are engrav'd from drawings procur’d by the author from the original pictures, which some accounts say were carried to
                    <placeName ref="pl0791">Switzerland</placeName>, and others, to <placeName ref="pl0925">France</placeName>. 
                    They could not be made from the drawings said to be by <persName ref="pe0438">Zuchero</persName>, and which were so long preserv’d at 
                    <placeName ref="pl1500">Buckingham house</placeName>, because they were bought by <persName ref="pe0434">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Walpole</persName>,
                    and are both now at <placeName ref="pl1501">Strawberry Hill</placeName>, and much esteem’d by their owner, who seems to think that the 
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar1069">The Triumphs of Riches</rs> is done by <persName ref="pe0906">Vosterman</persName>, and that of
                    <rs type="art" ref="ar1069">Poverty</rs> by <persName ref="pe0438">Zuchero</persName>. They are fine compositions, but I think much crowded, 
                    &amp; indelicate as to the figures, &amp; believe they differ in some respects, from the prints given by the <persName ref="pe0907">Editor of Holbein’s works</persName>.</p>

                <p>There was a royal incorporated society of Artists, that some time ago had their annual exhibition in <placeName ref="pl1502">Spring Garden</placeName>,
