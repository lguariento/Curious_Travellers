                <p>I must beg of you to send the 6 copies of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> vol. of your

                    who will pay for them. Pray repeat it as often as a volume comes out. </p>
                
                <p>In my calamitous journey to <placeName ref="pl0699">town</placeName> I had not leisure to see you which I regret. let me trouble you 
                    with two requests. You knew <sic>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></sic> <persName ref="pe0333">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persName>

                    <persName ref="pe1741">ten children</persName> in all I could, &amp; have been successful in raising a subscription of near 200£. 
                    The <persName ref="pe2124">2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> daughter</persName> is too old to be put out apprentice: she is above 22 years 
                    old but has been so well educated as to be very capable of being a teacher in any of the great boarding schools. She is sensible well 
                    disposed &amp; has been educated at <placeName ref="pl2424">chester school</placeName>. I shall be extremely obliged to you for enquiring at any of the great schools, &amp; 
                    you will do a truely charitable deed.</p>

                        children were admitted through election by ballot, following recommendation by petition. Meetings around this date do not record any recommendations 
                        made by Pennant, but note that no recommenders are named in the minutes for 2 February 1795, which may signal an omission in the records for that date.

                    know the rules. I gave the charity 100£ for which I never received the lest complim<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> or civility. A <persName ref="pe2125">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
